It cover topics, including design of classes, inheritance, graphical user interfaces, numerical methods, streams, threads, sensors, and data structures. Students use Java\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 programming language to complete weekly software assignments. All lectures are active learning sessions with lab exercises. Please bring your laptop computer to every class, and remember to sit in alternating rows. If you can\u2019t attend a lecture you must still do and hand in the active learning exercises by 7pm on the day of lecture. Active learning exercises are posted a week before lecture if you need to work on them early. Lecture notes and Java\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 files for each class are posted two or more days ahead of time. Please download the Java\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 files to your laptop before class. Solutions to lecture exercises and solution Java\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 files are posted about three hours after lecture on the same day. Each student will be assigned to a recitation section that will be held each week. Sections have up to 12 students. Attendance is mandatory. Please bring your laptop to your recitation section. 18.01 (Single Variable Calculus). We use calculus in class and homework. If you are a graduate student, you must register for 1.001 or 1.002 instead of 1.00. 1.001 is a 9 unit \u201cG\u201d subject. If you are a grad student and need 12 units, you may register for 1.002. Undergrads must register for 1.00; you cannot register for 1.001/1.002. You must add 1.00 to your registration in time to submit homework 1. Adds after that date are for exceptional circumstances only. Horstmann, Cay.Big Java. 4th ed. Wiley, 2009. ISBN: 9780470509487.

It\u2019s also on reserve at Barker andavailable online. Laptop computers are required for class participation in 1.00, in all lecture/lab and recitation sessions. Please use your own laptop if you own one; you must download Java (J2SE), Javadoc and the Eclipse interactive development environment (IDE); see theTools sectionfor directions. A laptop with at least 1 GB of memory running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Mac OSX or Linux is needed to run the 1.00 software. A limited number of loaner laptop computers are available; please contactIS&Tto request one. You may also share a laptop if necessary. Graded problem sets and quizzes will be returned in recitation about 10 days after they are submitted. Problem set grades, quiz and final exam grades will be available through class site gradebook. The \u2019late penalties\u2019 will not be reflected in the posted grades, but will be deducted from your total grade at the end of the term. ACTIVITIESPERCENTAGES 10 Problem Sets (each worth 4 points)40% 30 Active Learning Exercise Sessions (each worth 1/3 of a point)10% 2 In-class Quizzes (open book, open notes) (each worth 12 points)24% Final Exam during Finals Period (open book, open notes) (worth 20 points)20% Weekly Recitations, Graded on Attendance and Participation6% All 1.00/1.001/1.002 students are expected to adhere to the highest ethical standards in their work. Your conduct in 1.00/1.001/1.002 and more generally at MIT establishes habits of professional honesty that are likely to remain with you throughout your career. 1.00 problem sets are individual assignments, not team projects. What you turn in must be your own work. Rules for 1.00 problem sets are: 1. You may work with other students in understanding the homework problem statement, and reviewing the lecture notes, readings and recitation notes. 2. You may ask each other for assistance on questions of Java syntax and language features, but not on the program logic to answer homework questions. If discussions of syntax and language features involve examples, the examples must be different than the homework problem. 3. You must write the Java program code on your own for each assignment. You are not allowed to look at other students\u2019 solutions, or show your solutions to other students. Sharing code fragments or viewing or copying each other\u2019s code is a violation of the academic honesty policy. 4. If you need help to debug your program, obtain assistance from a TA during office hours. If you are working on the homework after office hours, you are allowed to ask other students for assistance in debugging your program. However, their assistance must be limited to determining what is wrong with your program. They may not correct or rewrite sections of it for you. 5. You may copy and modify programs given in lecture or recitation notes or used in lecture or recitation by the instructors or TAs. You may also copy and modify programs from the text used in this subject. Rules for 1.00 active learning exercises are: 1. If you do the exercises in class, you may work together, up to three people. Each person in the group may turn in the same solutions if they worked together. 2. If you do the exercises outside of class, you must do them individually. You may get help from other students as in homework sets, but what you turn in must be your own work. Any student that violates these guidelines may, at the discretion of the instructor-in-charge, receive an F as their final grade in 1.00/1.001/1.002. The 1.00 staff will also bring ethical violations to the attention of MIT authorities for appropriate disciplinary action. Problem sets are due Friday at noon; they are submitted electronically on the course Web site. You will receive one penalty-free extension until the following Monday noon per semester. No extensions beyond that, except for medical or family emergencies, which generally require a note from the dean. See the instructor if this occurs. Late homework submitted after Friday noon and before Monday noon, beyond the one free extension, is penalized 30 points. Homework submitted after Monday noon receives no credit, since solutions are posted then. If Monday is a holiday, the late deadline is the next day classes are held. If you hand in .class files (compiled code, not human readable) instead of .java files (source code, human readable), you will receive no credit. No exceptions. Double check what you hand in. If your submission is empty, even though you\u2019re sure you submitted it, you will receive no credit. No exceptions. You must request a makeup quiz at least two weeks before the quiz date, unless there is a medical or family emergency that arises after that. Email the head TA if you need a makeup quiz. Valid reasons include MIT-related travel and intercollegiate athletics. Schedule job and school interviews to avoid quiz dates; there are only two quizzes in 1.00 and you must be here for them. We do not automatically schedule makeup quizzes; if no one has requested one two weeks ahead of time, none will be offered (other than for medical or family emergency).

The course focuses on probability theory and its applications, with a smaller module at the end covering basic topics in statistics (parameter estimation, hypothesis testing and regression analysis). The probability modules cover events and their probability, the total probability and Bayes\u2019 theorems, discrete and continuous random variables and vectors, the Bernoulli trial sequence and Poisson process models, conditional distributions, functions of random variables and vectors, statistical moments, second-moment uncertainty propagation and second-moment conditional analysis, and various probability models such as the exponential, gamma, normal, lognormal, uniform, beta and extreme-type distributions. Throughout the subjects, concepts are illustrated with examples from various areas of engineering and everyday life.

Students learn the basic techniques of engineering economics, including net present value analysis, life-cycle costing, benefit-cost analysis, and other approaches to project evaluation. There is an emphasis on the role of uncertainty in project evaluation. Examples are drawn from building design and construction, transportation systems, urban development, environmental projects, water resource management, and other elements of both public and private infrastructure. Students form and work in teams during the semester on evaluating a project of interest to each team, subject to approval of the teaching staff. The links below provide more information on specific topics covered in this course, as well as a list of subject keywords.

While it is possible to apply standard techniques of engineering economics in assessing costs and benefits, most large-scale projects have inherent evaluative complexity with significant cost and benefits that are either difficult to predict, difficult to convert to monetary terms, or controversial, at least to a subset of relevant stakeholders. This project is designed to expose you to these complexities, give you a chance to study in depth how project evaluation is implemented in practice, how it relates to the design process and try your hand at evaluating a major project. Prepare a case study of the evaluation process for a major project. The project could be historical, recent past, current, or proposed; it could be a project that was successfully implemented, implemented but unsuccessful, or never implemented. If you are feeling particularly adventurous, you may even produce your own preliminary analysis of a project that as of yet exists only in the realm of ideas (just remember, it has to make sense). Based on past years, we are guessing that many of you will choose a large infrastructure project. Projects such as the new bridge near the Hoover Dam, buildings (The Z Center at MIT and the Hancock Building in Boston were both selected in the past, and also the rehabilitation of a high school in Greenwich, CT), rehabilitation of the Washington Metro, financing and building a nuclear power plant \u00e2\u0080\u0094 actually two \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in Georgia), high-speed rail in the Northeast Corridor and the Trans-Alaska pipeline are options, but we are open to other ideas. This is a group project, to be prepared in teams of 2-3 students. While components of analysis may (and should) be split up within the group, every member should be engaged in the entire process and grading will be by group. Of course, more content will be expected from 3-person groups than from 2-person groups. The case study should be about 15 pages long, including: The topic selection is intentionally open-ended. To ensure wise project choices, each group will meet with the instructors following submission of the initial project proposal. You will present your proposal and we will critique. This is our way of assuring you are on the right track, and this is your chance to refine your proposal and ask questions. When developing your project, please review the project evaluation checklist to make sure all the important issues have been considered. Project Evaluation Checklist In addition to our feedback on your proposal, there are two formal progress reports with specific deliverables on which we can provide feedback as well. Each progress report should also include any questions that have come up in the course of your analysis. We will do our best to answer your questions or talk you through the issues. Projects often evolve from your original thoughts during the semester; the progress report is a means by which to document that evolution as well as giving the teaching staff the opportunity to weigh in.

The class includes several homework sets and three quizzes held during the two hour recitation periods. The grade will be based 40% on homework and in-class exercises and 20% on each of the three quizzes. The lowest homework grade will not be counted.\u00c2 There will be no final exam.

It cover topics, including design of classes, inheritance, graphical user interfaces, numerical methods, streams, threads, sensors, and data structures. Students use Java\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 programming language to complete weekly software assignments. All lectures are active learning sessions with lab exercises. Please bring your laptop computer to every class, and remember to sit in alternating rows. If you can\u2019t attend a lecture you must still do and hand in the active learning exercises by 7pm on the day of lecture. Active learning exercises are posted a week before lecture if you need to work on them early. Lecture notes and Java\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 files for each class are posted two or more days ahead of time. Please download the Java\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 files to your laptop before class. Solutions to lecture exercises and solution Java\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 files are posted about three hours after lecture on the same day. Each student will be assigned to a recitation section that will be held each week. Sections have up to 12 students. Attendance is mandatory. Please bring your laptop to your recitation section. 18.01 (Single Variable Calculus). We use calculus in class and homework. If you are a graduate student, you must register for 1.001 or 1.002 instead of 1.00. 1.001 is a 9 unit \u201cG\u201d subject. If you are a grad student and need 12 units, you may register for 1.002. Undergrads must register for 1.00; you cannot register for 1.001/1.002. You must add 1.00 to your registration in time to submit homework 1. Adds after that date are for exceptional circumstances only. Horstmann, Cay.Big Java. 4th ed. Wiley, 2009. ISBN: 9780470509487.

Please use your own laptop if you own one; you must download Java (J2SE), Javadoc and the Eclipse interactive development environment (IDE); see theTools sectionfor directions. A laptop with at least 1 GB of memory running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Mac OSX or Linux is needed to run the 1.00 software. A limited number of loaner laptop computers are available; please contactIS&Tto request one. You may also share a laptop if necessary. Graded problem sets and quizzes will be returned in recitation about 10 days after they are submitted. Problem set grades, quiz and final exam grades will be available through class site gradebook. The \u2019late penalties\u2019 will not be reflected in the posted grades, but will be deducted from your total grade at the end of the term. ACTIVITIESPERCENTAGES 10 Problem Sets (each worth 4 points)40% 30 Active Learning Exercise Sessions (each worth 1/3 of a point)10% 2 In-class Quizzes (open book, open notes) (each worth 12 points)24% Final Exam during Finals Period (open book, open notes) (worth 20 points)20% Weekly Recitations, Graded on Attendance and Participation6% All 1.00/1.001/1.002 students are expected to adhere to the highest ethical standards in their work. Your conduct in 1.00/1.001/1.002 and more generally at MIT establishes habits of professional honesty that are likely to remain with you throughout your career. 1.00 problem sets are individual assignments, not team projects. What you turn in must be your own work. Rules for 1.00 problem sets are: 1. You may work with other students in understanding the homework problem statement, and reviewing the lecture notes, readings and recitation notes. 2. You may ask each other for assistance on questions of Java syntax and language features, but not on the program logic to answer homework questions. If discussions of syntax and language features involve examples, the examples must be different than the homework problem. 3. You must write the Java program code on your own for each assignment. You are not allowed to look at other students\u2019 solutions, or show your solutions to other students. Sharing code fragments or viewing or copying each other\u2019s code is a violation of the academic honesty policy. 4. If you need help to debug your program, obtain assistance from a TA during office hours. If you are working on the homework after office hours, you are allowed to ask other students for assistance in debugging your program. However, their assistance must be limited to determining what is wrong with your program. They may not correct or rewrite sections of it for you. 5. You may copy and modify programs given in lecture or recitation notes or used in lecture or recitation by the instructors or TAs. You may also copy and modify programs from the text used in this subject. Rules for 1.00 active learning exercises are: 1. If you do the exercises in class, you may work together, up to three people. Each person in the group may turn in the same solutions if they worked together. 2. If you do the exercises outside of class, you must do them individually. You may get help from other students as in homework sets, but what you turn in must be your own work. Any student that violates these guidelines may, at the discretion of the instructor-in-charge, receive an F as their final grade in 1.00/1.001/1.002. The 1.00 staff will also bring ethical violations to the attention of MIT authorities for appropriate disciplinary action. Problem sets are due Friday at noon; they are submitted electronically on the course Web site. You will receive one penalty-free extension until the following Monday noon per semester. No extensions beyond that, except for medical or family emergencies, which generally require a note from the dean. See the instructor if this occurs. Late homework submitted after Friday noon and before Monday noon, beyond the one free extension, is penalized 30 points. Homework submitted after Monday noon receives no credit, since solutions are posted then. If Monday is a holiday, the late deadline is the next day classes are held. If you hand in .class files (compiled code, not human readable) instead of .java files (source code, human readable), you will receive no credit. No exceptions. Double check what you hand in. If your submission is empty, even though you\u2019re sure you submitted it, you will receive no credit. No exceptions. You must request a makeup quiz at least two weeks before the quiz date, unless there is a medical or family emergency that arises after that. Email the head TA if you need a makeup quiz. Valid reasons include MIT-related travel and intercollegiate athletics. Schedule job and school interviews to avoid quiz dates; there are only two quizzes in 1.00 and you must be here for them. We do not automatically schedule makeup quizzes; if no one has requested one two weeks ahead of time, none will be offered (other than for medical or family emergency).
