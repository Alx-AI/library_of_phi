# Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications":


## Foreward

Welcome to "Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications"! This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of queueing theory, from its basic principles to its advanced applications. As a fundamental concept in computer science, queueing theory has been widely used in various fields, including networking, telecommunications, and operating systems. With the increasing complexity of modern systems, the demand for efficient and fair resource allocation has become more critical than ever. Queueing theory provides a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing the performance of such systems.

In this book, we will explore the concept of fair queuing, which is a fundamental aspect of queueing theory. Fair queuing aims to distribute resources fairly among competing flows, ensuring that no flow is starved of resources while others dominate. We will specifically focus on the byte-weighted fair queuing algorithm, which attempts to emulate the fairness of bitwise round-robin sharing of link resources among competing flows. This algorithm is of great importance in packet-based flows, where packets must be transmitted in sequence.

The complexity of the byte-weighted fair queuing algorithm is "O(log(n))", where "n" is the number of queues/flows. To reduce the computational load, the concept of "virtual time" is introduced. This allows for the modeling of finish time on an alternate monotonically increasing virtual timescale, reducing the need for recomputation of finish time for previously queued packets. This concept is crucial in achieving efficient and fair resource allocation in complex systems.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals interested in queueing theory. It is designed to be accessible to advanced undergraduate students at MIT and provides a solid foundation for further exploration of this fascinating topic. We have included detailed algorithmic details and examples to aid in understanding the concepts presented. We hope that this book will inspire readers to explore the vast applications of queueing theory and contribute to its ongoing development.

Thank you for choosing "Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications" as your guide to this exciting field. We hope you enjoy the journey ahead.

Happy reading!

Sincerely,

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

Queueing theory is a branch of applied mathematics that studies the behavior of waiting lines or queues. It is a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing systems that involve the flow of customers, such as call centers, transportation systems, and manufacturing processes. In this book, we will explore the fundamentals of queueing theory and its advanced applications.

In this first chapter, we will focus on the M/M/s type systems, which are the simplest and most commonly used models in queueing theory. The M/M/s type systems are characterized by having a single queue, Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, and s servers. We will delve into the fundamental insights of these systems, including their steady-state behavior, performance measures, and stability conditions.

We will start by introducing the basic concepts and notation of queueing theory, such as arrival rate, service rate, and utilization. Then, we will derive the steady-state probabilities of the M/M/s type systems using the birth-death process. These probabilities will allow us to calculate important performance measures, such as the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the probability of waiting. We will also discuss the stability conditions of these systems, which determine whether the queue will grow indefinitely or reach a steady-state.

Understanding the M/M/s type systems is crucial as they serve as building blocks for more complex queueing models. Moreover, many real-world systems can be approximated by these models, making them highly applicable in various fields. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the fundamental insights of the M/M/s type systems, laying the foundation for the advanced applications that will be covered in the following chapters.

The M/M/s type systems are characterized by having a single queue, Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, and s servers. We will delve into the fundamental insights of these systems, including their steady-state behavior, performance measures, and stability conditions.

### Section: Introduction to Queueing Systems

Queueing systems are an essential part of many real-world systems, and understanding their behavior is crucial for optimizing their performance. A queueing system consists of three main components: arrivals, service, and waiting line. The arrivals refer to the customers or jobs that enter the system, while the service refers to the process of completing the job or serving the customer. The waiting line is the queue where customers wait for service.

### Subsection: Definition and Components of Queueing Systems

To better understand the behavior of queueing systems, we use various metrics to measure their performance. These metrics include arrival rate, service rate, utilization, and waiting time. The arrival rate, denoted by λ, is the average number of arrivals per unit time. The service rate, denoted by μ, is the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. Utilization, denoted by ρ, is the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate, and it measures the efficiency of the system. The waiting time is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served.

In this chapter, we will focus on the M/M/s type systems, which are characterized by having a single queue, Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, and s servers. These systems are widely used as building blocks for more complex queueing models and can be applied to various real-world systems. By understanding the fundamental insights of the M/M/s type systems, readers will have a solid foundation for exploring more advanced applications in the following chapters.

### Subsection: Deriving Steady-State Probabilities using the Birth-Death Process

The steady-state probabilities of a queueing system refer to the long-term probabilities of the system being in a particular state. In the case of the M/M/s type systems, the states refer to the number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. These probabilities can be derived using the birth-death process, which is a mathematical model used to analyze systems with discrete states and transitions between them.

### Subsection: Calculating Performance Measures and Stability Conditions

Once we have the steady-state probabilities, we can calculate important performance measures of the M/M/s type systems. These measures include the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the probability of waiting. These metrics are crucial for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the system and can help in identifying areas for improvement.

Moreover, the steady-state probabilities also allow us to determine the stability conditions of the M/M/s type systems. These conditions determine whether the queue will grow indefinitely or reach a steady-state. Understanding the stability conditions is essential for ensuring the smooth operation of the system and avoiding potential issues such as congestion and long waiting times.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have introduced the basic concepts and components of queueing systems and discussed the importance of understanding their behavior. We have also highlighted the significance of the M/M/s type systems and their applications in various real-world systems. In the next section, we will delve into the fundamental insights of these systems and explore their steady-state behavior, performance measures, and stability conditions in more detail.

### Section: Introduction to Queueing Systems

Queueing systems are an essential part of many real-world systems, and understanding their behavior is crucial for optimizing their performance. A queueing system consists of three main components: arrivals, service, and waiting line. The arrivals refer to the customers or jobs that enter the system, while the service refers to the process of completing the job or serving the customer. The waiting line is the queue where customers wait for service.

### Subsection: Definition and Components of Queueing Systems

To better understand the behavior of queueing systems, we use various metrics to measure their performance. These metrics include arrival rate, service rate, utilization, and waiting time. The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is the average number of arrivals per unit time. The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. Utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate, and it measures the efficiency of the system. The waiting time is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served.

### Subsection: Characteristics of Queueing Systems

In addition to the basic components and metrics, there are several characteristics that are important to consider when analyzing queueing systems. These include the arrival process, service time distribution, number of servers, and queue discipline.

The arrival process refers to the pattern of customer arrivals, which can be modeled as either deterministic or stochastic. In deterministic arrival processes, the arrivals occur at fixed intervals, while in stochastic arrival processes, the arrivals follow a random pattern. The most commonly used stochastic arrival process is the Poisson process, which assumes that the arrivals occur independently and at a constant rate.

The service time distribution refers to the probability distribution of the time it takes to serve a customer. In queueing theory, the most commonly used service time distribution is the exponential distribution, which assumes that the service times are independent and exponentially distributed.

The number of servers in a queueing system can vary, and it is denoted by the letter $s$. In the M/M/s type systems, there are a fixed number of servers, while in other systems, the number of servers can change over time.

The queue discipline refers to the rules that determine which customer will be served next when there are multiple customers waiting in the queue. Some common queue disciplines include first-come-first-served (FCFS), last-come-first-served (LCFS), and priority-based.

Understanding these characteristics is crucial for analyzing and optimizing queueing systems. In the next section, we will focus on the M/M/s type systems, which are characterized by having a single queue, Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, and s servers. We will explore the fundamental insights of these systems and their applications in various real-world scenarios.

The arrivals refer to the customers or jobs that enter the system, while the service refers to the process of completing the job or serving the customer.

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is the average number of arrivals per unit time. The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. Utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate, and it measures the efficiency of the system. The waiting time is the amount of time a customer spends in the queue before being served.

### Subsection: 1.2a Definition and Properties of Markovian Arrival Process

In queueing theory, the Markovian Arrival Process (MAP) is a stochastic process that models the arrival of customers in a queueing system. It is a continuous-time Markov chain, where the arrival rate of customers follows a Poisson distribution. This means that the number of arrivals in a given time interval is independent of the number of arrivals in any other time interval.

The MAP has several properties that make it a useful tool for modeling queueing systems. First, it is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an arrival occurring in a given time interval depends only on the length of that interval and not on any previous arrivals. Second, it is stationary, meaning that the arrival rate remains constant over time. Finally, it is Markovian, meaning that the future behavior of the process depends only on its current state and not on its past states.

The MAP is a fundamental concept in queueing theory and is used to model a wide range of real-world systems. Its properties make it a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing queueing systems, and we will explore its applications in more detail in later chapters.


## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Section: 1.2 Markovian Arrival Process

The Markovian Arrival Process (MAP) is a stochastic process that models the arrival of customers in a queueing system. It is a popular model in queueing theory due to its simplicity and ability to capture the randomness of real-world arrival processes. The MAP is a special case of the more general Markovian Arrival Process with Renewal (MAP/R) model, which allows for non-exponential inter-arrival times.

### Subsection: 1.2b Arrival Rate and Arrival Time Distribution

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is a key parameter in the MAP model. It represents the average number of arrivals per unit time and is often assumed to be constant. However, in some cases, the arrival rate may vary over time, and this can be modeled using a time-varying arrival rate function.

The arrival time distribution, denoted by $F_A(t)$, is another important aspect of the MAP model. It describes the probability that a customer arrives within a given time interval. In the case of a constant arrival rate, the arrival time distribution follows an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$. This means that the probability of a customer arriving within a time interval of length $t$ is given by $1-e^{-\lambda t}$. However, in the case of a time-varying arrival rate, the arrival time distribution may follow a different distribution, such as a Weibull distribution.

The choice of arrival time distribution is crucial in accurately modeling real-world arrival processes. For example, in the case of web traffic, the Weibull distribution has been shown to better capture the heavy-tailed nature of the inter-arrival times compared to the exponential distribution. This is important because heavy-tailed distributions have a higher probability of large inter-arrival times, which can significantly impact the performance of queueing systems.

In summary, the arrival rate and arrival time distribution are key components of the MAP model and play a crucial role in accurately modeling real-world arrival processes. In the next section, we will explore the performance measures of the M/M/s type systems, which are based on the assumptions of Poisson arrivals and exponential service times.


## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Section: 1.3 Exponential Service Time

In the previous section, we discussed the Markovian Arrival Process (MAP) and its key parameters, the arrival rate and arrival time distribution. In this section, we will focus on the service time, which is another important aspect of queueing systems.

The service time, denoted by $S$, is the amount of time a customer spends in service at a particular facility. In the case of a single server queue, the service time is often assumed to follow an exponential distribution with parameter $\mu$. This means that the probability of a customer completing service within a time interval of length $t$ is given by $1-e^{-\mu t}$.

#### 1.3a Definition and Properties of Exponential Service Time

The exponential service time is a continuous random variable with a probability density function (PDF) of the form:

$$
f_S(t) = \begin{cases}
\mu e^{-\mu t}, & t \geq 0 \\
0, & t < 0
\end{cases}
$$

The mean service time, denoted by $E[S]$, is given by the inverse of the service rate, $\mu^{-1}$. This means that on average, a customer will spend $\mu^{-1}$ units of time in service.

The exponential service time also has the property of memorylessness, which means that the probability of a customer completing service within a time interval of length $t$ is independent of the time already spent in service. This property is useful in queueing theory as it simplifies the analysis of queueing systems.

In summary, the exponential service time is a commonly used model for service times in queueing systems due to its simplicity and memorylessness property. However, in some cases, the service time may follow a different distribution, such as a Weibull distribution, to better capture the characteristics of the system. In the next section, we will discuss the M/M/s type systems, which are a class of queueing systems that assume exponential service times.

This means that the probability of a customer completing service within a time interval of length $t$ is given by $1-e^{-\mu t}$.

$$
f_S(t) = \begin{cases}
\mu e^{-\mu t}, & t \geq 0 \\
0, & t < 0
\end{cases}
$$

The mean service time, denoted by $E[S]$, is given by the inverse of the service rate, $\mu^{-1}$. This means that on average, a customer will spend $\mu^{-1}$ units of time in service.

The exponential service time also has the property of memorylessness, which means that the probability of a customer completing service within a time interval of length $t$ is independent of the time already spent in service. This property is useful in queueing theory as it simplifies the analysis of queueing systems.

#### 1.3b Service Rate and Service Time Distribution

The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is a key parameter in queueing systems that determines the speed at which customers are served. It is often referred to as the "inverse of the mean service time" and is measured in units of time$^{-1}$. In other words, it represents the average number of customers that can be served per unit of time.

As mentioned earlier, the service time in a single server queue is often assumed to follow an exponential distribution. However, this may not always be the case in real-world systems. For example, in a call center, the service time may follow a Weibull distribution, which takes into account the variability in the length of customer calls. In such cases, the service rate can be calculated using the mean service time and the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution.

In summary, the service rate and service time distribution are important concepts in queueing theory that help us understand the behavior of queueing systems. In the next section, we will discuss the M/M/s type systems, which are a class of queueing systems that assume exponential service times.


# Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

## Chapter 1: Fundamental Insights: The M/M/s Type Systems

### Section 1.4: Single Server Queues

In the previous section, we discussed the M/M/c queue, which is a queueing system with `c` servers. In this section, we will focus on the M/M/1 queue, which is a special case of the M/M/c queue with only one server. This queueing system is also known as the single server queue and is one of the most fundamental and widely studied queueing systems.

### Subsection 1.4a: Analysis of M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue is a Markovian queueing system with a single server and a Poisson arrival process. The service time of this queue is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with parameter `μ`. In this subsection, we will analyze the M/M/1 queue and discuss its key properties.

#### 1.4a.1: Probability Mass Function of M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue has a stationary distribution with a probability mass function given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & k = 0,1,2,... \\
0, & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$

where `ρ` is the traffic intensity, defined as `ρ = λ/(cμ)`, and `π`<sub>`k`</sub> is the probability that the system contains `k` customers. This distribution is often referred to as the Erlang distribution and is commonly used in queueing theory.

#### 1.4a.2: Erlang's C Formula

The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by Erlang's C formula:

$$
C(c,\lambda/\mu) = \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^c}{c!} \frac{1}{1-(\lambda/\mu)^c}
$$

This formula is also known as the Erlang loss formula and is often denoted as C(`c`, `λ`/`μ`) or E<sub>2,`c`</sub>(`λ`/`μ`). It is used to calculate the probability of a customer being rejected due to a full queue.

#### 1.4a.3: Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system (in service and in the queue) is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu) + c \rho
$$

where `L` is the average number of customers and `ρ` is the traffic intensity. This formula takes into account both the customers in service and those waiting in the queue.

### 1.4a.4: Busy Period of M/M/1 Queue

The busy period of the M/M/1 queue refers to the time interval during which the server is continuously busy serving customers. It can be defined as the minimum time `T`<sub>`k`</sub> such that there are `k` customers in the system at time 0<sup>+</sup> and `k`-1 customers in the system at time `T`<sub>`k`</sub>. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the distribution of `T`<sub>`k`</sub> is given by:

$$
\eta_k(s) = \frac{1}{s} \frac{1}{1-\rho} \frac{1}{1-\frac{\lambda}{c\mu}e^{-s/\mu}}
$$

This transform can be used to calculate the probability of the server being busy for a given amount of time.

### 1.4a.5: Response Time of M/M/1 Queue

The response time is the total amount of time a customer spends in both the queue and in service. The average response time for the M/M/1 queue is given by:

$$
R = \frac{\text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu)}{c\mu-\lambda} + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

This formula is independent of the service discipline and is the same for all work conserving service disciplines. It takes into account both the time spent in the queue and the time spent in service.

#### 1.4a.5a: Customers in First-Come, First-Served Discipline

In the first-come, first-served discipline, the customer either experiences an immediate exponential service or must wait for `k` customers to be served before their own service. In this case, the customer's service time follows an Erlang distribution with shape parameter `k`+1.

#### 1.4a.5b: Customers in Processor Sharing Discipline

In the processor sharing discipline, the service capacity of the queue is split equally between the jobs in the queue. In the M/M/1 queue, this means that when there are `c` or fewer jobs in the system, each job is serviced at rate `μ`. However, when there are more than `c` jobs in the system, the service rate is reduced to `μ/c` for each job. This results in a longer response time for customers in this discipline.


# Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

## Chapter 1: Fundamental Insights: The M/M/s Type Systems

### Section 1.4: Single Server Queues

In the previous section, we discussed the M/M/c queue, which is a queueing system with `c` servers. In this section, we will focus on the M/M/1 queue, which is a special case of the M/M/c queue with only one server. This queueing system is also known as the single server queue and is one of the most fundamental and widely studied queueing systems.

### Subsection 1.4a: Analysis of M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue is a Markovian queueing system with a single server and a Poisson arrival process. The service time of this queue is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with parameter `μ`. In this subsection, we will analyze the M/M/1 queue and discuss its key properties.

#### 1.4a.1: Probability Mass Function of M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue has a stationary distribution with a probability mass function given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & k = 0,1,2,... \\
0, & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$

where `ρ` is the traffic intensity, defined as `ρ = λ/(cμ)`, and `π`<sub>`k`</sub> is the probability that the system contains `k` customers. This distribution is often referred to as the Erlang distribution and is commonly used in queueing theory.

#### 1.4a.2: Erlang's C Formula

The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by Erlang's C formula:

$$
C(c,\lambda/\mu) = \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^c}{c!} \frac{1}{1-(\lambda/\mu)^c}
$$

This formula is also known as the Erlang loss formula and is often denoted as C(`c`, `λ`/`μ`) or E<sub>2,`c`</sub>(`λ`/`μ`). It is used to calculate the probability of a customer being rejected due to a full queue.

#### 1.4a.3: Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system (in service and in the queue) is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu) + c \rho
$$

This equation is derived from the Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. In the case of the M/M/1 queue, the average time a customer spends in the system is equal to the average number of customers in the system divided by the service rate `μ`. Therefore, we can write:

$$
L = \lambda \frac{L}{\mu} + c \rho
$$

Solving for `L`, we get:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu) + c \rho
$$

This equation gives us the average number of customers in the system, taking into account both the customers in service and in the queue.

#### 1.4a.4: Average Waiting Time in the Queue

The average waiting time in the queue is given by:

$$
W_q = \frac{L}{\lambda} = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu)
$$

This equation is derived from Little's Law, where `W_q` represents the average waiting time in the queue and `L` represents the average number of customers in the system.

### Subsection 1.4b: Performance Measures of M/M/1 Queue

In this subsection, we will discuss the various performance measures of the M/M/1 queue, including the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time in the queue, and the probability of a customer being rejected due to a full queue.

#### 1.4b.1: Average Number of Customers in the System

As discussed in the previous subsection, the average number of customers in the system is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu) + c \rho
$$

This equation takes into account both the customers in service and in the queue, and is a key performance measure for the M/M/1 queue.

#### 1.4b.2: Average Waiting Time in the Queue

The average waiting time in the queue is given by:

$$
W_q = \frac{L}{\lambda} = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu)
$$

This equation represents the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is an important performance measure for the M/M/1 queue, as it directly affects the customer experience.

#### 1.4b.3: Probability of Rejection

The probability that an arriving customer is rejected due to a full queue is given by Erlang's C formula:

$$
C(c,\lambda/\mu) = \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^c}{c!} \frac{1}{1-(\lambda/\mu)^c}
$$

This formula is used to calculate the probability of a customer being rejected due to a full queue. It is an important performance measure for the M/M/1 queue, as it indicates the efficiency of the system in handling incoming customers. 


# Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

## Chapter 1: Fundamental Insights: The M/M/s Type Systems

### Section 1.5: Multiple Server Queues

In the previous section, we discussed the M/M/c queue, which is a queueing system with `c` servers. In this section, we will focus on the M/M/s queue, which is a special case of the M/M/c queue with `s` servers. This queueing system is also known as the multiple server queue and is commonly used in real-world applications.

### Subsection 1.5a: Analysis of M/M/s Queue

The M/M/s queue is a Markovian queueing system with `s` servers and a Poisson arrival process. The service time of this queue is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with parameter `μ`. In this subsection, we will analyze the M/M/s queue and discuss its key properties.

#### 1.5a.1: Probability Mass Function of M/M/s Queue

The M/M/s queue has a stationary distribution with a probability mass function given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & k = 0,1,2,...,s \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^s}{s!}(s\rho)^{k-s}, & k = s+1,s+2,... \\
0, & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$

where `ρ` is the traffic intensity, defined as `ρ = λ/(sμ)`, and `π`<sub>`k`</sub> is the probability that the system contains `k` customers. This distribution is often referred to as the Erlang distribution and is commonly used in queueing theory.

#### 1.5a.2: Erlang's C Formula

The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by Erlang's C formula:

$$
C(s,\lambda/\mu) = \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^s}{s!} \frac{1}{1-(\lambda/\mu)^s}
$$

This formula is also known as the Erlang loss formula and is often denoted as C(`s`, `λ`/`μ`) or E<sub>2,`s`</sub>(`λ`/`μ`). It is used to calculate the probability of a customer being rejected due to a full queue.

#### 1.5a.3: Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system (in service and in the queue) is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \text{ C(s,\lambda/\mu)} + s \rho
$$

This equation takes into account the fact that there are `s` servers in the system, and thus the average number of customers in the system is the sum of the average number of customers in the queue and the average number of customers being served.

#### 1.5a.4: Utilization Factor

The utilization factor `ρ` is an important metric in queueing theory as it represents the ratio of the average arrival rate to the average service rate. In the M/M/s queue, the utilization factor is defined as `ρ = λ/(sμ)`. When `ρ` is close to 1, it indicates that the system is heavily loaded and may experience long queues and delays.

#### 1.5a.5: Little's Law

Little's Law is a fundamental theorem in queueing theory that states that the average number of customers in a stable system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. In the M/M/s queue, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where `L` is the average number of customers in the system, `λ` is the average arrival rate, and `W` is the average time a customer spends in the system.

#### 1.5a.6: Mean Waiting Time

The mean waiting time `W` is another important metric in queueing theory as it represents the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. In the M/M/s queue, the mean waiting time can be calculated as:

$$
W = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda} \text{ C(s,\lambda/\mu)}
$$

This equation takes into account the fact that there are `s` servers in the system, and thus the mean waiting time is the sum of the mean waiting time in the queue and the mean service time.

#### 1.5a.7: Throughput

The throughput `X` is the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. In the M/M/s queue, the throughput can be calculated as:

$$
X = \lambda (1 - C(s,\lambda/\mu))
$$

This equation takes into account the fact that some customers may be rejected due to a full queue, and thus the throughput is the product of the arrival rate and the probability that a customer is not rejected.

#### 1.5a.8: Little's Formula for M/M/s Queue

Little's Formula can also be applied to the M/M/s queue, and it states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. In the M/M/s queue, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W_s
$$

where `L` is the average number of customers in the system, `λ` is the average arrival rate, and `W_s` is the average time a customer spends in the system, including both the waiting time and the service time.

#### 1.5a.9: Comparison to M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/s queue can be seen as an extension of the M/M/1 queue, where `s` servers are available instead of just one. As a result, the M/M/s queue has a higher throughput and lower mean waiting time compared to the M/M/1 queue. However, it also has a higher complexity and cost due to the need for multiple servers.

#### 1.5a.10: Applications of M/M/s Queue

The M/M/s queue is commonly used in various real-world applications, such as call centers, customer service centers, and computer networks. It is also used in the analysis of traffic flow and congestion in transportation systems. Understanding the properties and behavior of the M/M/s queue is essential for optimizing the performance and efficiency of these systems.


# Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

## Chapter 1: Fundamental Insights: The M/M/s Type Systems

### Section 1.5: Multiple Server Queues

In the previous section, we discussed the M/M/c queue, which is a queueing system with `c` servers. In this section, we will focus on the M/M/s queue, which is a special case of the M/M/c queue with `s` servers. This queueing system is also known as the multiple server queue and is commonly used in real-world applications.

### Subsection 1.5a: Analysis of M/M/s Queue

The M/M/s queue is a Markovian queueing system with `s` servers and a Poisson arrival process. The service time of this queue is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with parameter `μ`. In this subsection, we will analyze the M/M/s queue and discuss its key properties.

#### 1.5a.1: Probability Mass Function of M/M/s Queue

The M/M/s queue has a stationary distribution with a probability mass function given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & k = 0,1,2,...,s \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^s}{s!}(s\rho)^{k-s}, & k = s+1,s+2,... \\
0, & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$

where `ρ` is the traffic intensity, defined as `ρ = λ/(sμ)`, and `π`<sub>`k`</sub> is the probability that the system contains `k` customers. This distribution is often referred to as the Erlang distribution and is commonly used in queueing theory.

This probability mass function can be derived using the Markovian property of the M/M/s queue, which states that the future behavior of the system depends only on its current state and not on its past history. By considering the arrival and service processes, we can derive the probability of having `k` customers in the system at any given time.

#### 1.5a.2: Erlang's C Formula

The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by Erlang's C formula:

$$
C(s,\lambda/\mu) = \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^s}{s!} \frac{1}{1-(\lambda/\mu)^s}
$$

This formula is also known as the Erlang loss formula and is often denoted as C(`s`, `λ`/`μ`) or E<sub>2,`s`</sub>(`λ`/`μ`). It is used to calculate the probability of a customer being rejected due to a full queue.

Erlang's C formula is derived by considering the probability of all `s` servers being occupied and no customers in the queue. This probability is then subtracted from 1 to get the probability of a customer being forced to join the queue.

#### 1.5a.3: Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system (in service and in the queue) is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}
$$

This formula can be derived by considering the expected number of customers in the system at any given time. By using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time spent in the system, we can derive the formula for `L`.

### Subsection 1.5b: Performance Measures of M/M/s Queue

In addition to the probability mass function and Erlang's C formula, there are other performance measures that are commonly used to analyze the M/M/s queue. These include the average waiting time, the average queue length, and the utilization of the servers.

#### 1.5b.1: Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time in the M/M/s queue is given by:

$$
W = \frac{\rho}{\mu(1-\rho)}
$$

This formula can be derived by considering the expected time a customer spends in the queue before being served. By using Little's Law, we can relate the average waiting time to the average queue length.

#### 1.5b.2: Average Queue Length

The average queue length in the M/M/s queue is given by:

$$
L_q = \frac{\rho^2}{1-\rho}
$$

This formula can be derived by considering the expected number of customers in the queue at any given time. By using Little's Law, we can relate the average queue length to the average waiting time.

#### 1.5b.3: Utilization of Servers

The utilization of the servers in the M/M/s queue is given by:

$$
U = \frac{\rho}{s}
$$

This formula can be derived by considering the expected time a server is busy serving a customer. By using Little's Law, we can relate the utilization of servers to the average waiting time.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction:

In this chapter, we will delve into one of the most fundamental and widely used laws in queueing theory - Little's Law. This law, first introduced by John Little in 1961, provides a simple yet powerful relationship between the average number of customers in a queue, the average time spent in the queue, and the average arrival rate of customers. Little's Law has found numerous applications in various fields, including telecommunications, computer science, and operations research. 

We will begin by discussing the basic concepts and assumptions of Little's Law, followed by its mathematical formulation and proof. We will then explore some of its generalizations, such as the Extended Little's Law and the Generalized Little's Law, which take into account more complex scenarios and systems. These generalizations have further expanded the applicability of Little's Law and have been instrumental in solving real-world problems. 

Furthermore, we will also discuss the limitations and assumptions of Little's Law, as well as its implications in different queueing systems. We will explore how this law can be used to optimize system performance and improve customer satisfaction. Additionally, we will provide examples and case studies to illustrate the practical applications of Little's Law and its generalizations. 

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Little's Law and its generalizations, and how they can be applied to solve various queueing problems. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in this fundamental law and will be able to apply it to analyze and optimize queueing systems in their own fields of study or work. 


# Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations

### Section 2.1: Arrival Rate and Arrival Process

In this section, we will discuss the fundamental concepts of arrival rate and arrival process in queueing theory. These concepts are essential in understanding Little's Law and its generalizations, as they form the basis of queueing systems.

#### 2.1a: Definition and Calculation of Arrival Rate

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is defined as the average number of customers arriving at a queueing system per unit time. It is a crucial parameter in queueing theory, as it determines the rate at which the queueing system is being loaded. The arrival rate can be calculated by dividing the total number of arrivals by the total time period. For example, if a queueing system has 100 arrivals in 10 minutes, the arrival rate would be 10 customers per minute.

The arrival process, on the other hand, refers to the pattern or distribution of arrivals over time. It can be described by a probability distribution, such as the Poisson distribution, which is commonly used to model arrival processes in queueing theory. The arrival process is also characterized by its arrival rate, which remains constant in a Poisson process.

In some cases, the arrival rate may not be constant, and it may vary over time. In such scenarios, the arrival process is said to be non-stationary. In these cases, the arrival rate can be calculated by taking the average of the arrival rates at different time intervals.

The arrival rate is a critical factor in queueing systems, as it affects the performance and behavior of the system. A higher arrival rate leads to longer queues and increased waiting times, while a lower arrival rate results in shorter queues and reduced waiting times. Therefore, understanding and accurately calculating the arrival rate is crucial in analyzing and optimizing queueing systems.

In the next section, we will explore Little's Law, which provides a fundamental relationship between the arrival rate, the average number of customers in a queue, and the average waiting time. This law has been widely used in various fields and has paved the way for more advanced generalizations, which we will discuss in later sections.

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is defined as the average number of customers arriving at a queueing system per unit time. It is a crucial parameter in queueing theory, as it determines the rate at which the queueing system is being loaded. The arrival rate can be calculated by dividing the total number of arrivals by the total time period.

The arrival rate is a critical factor in queueing systems, as it affects the performance and behavior of the system. A higher arrival rate leads to longer queues and increased waiting times, while a lower arrival rate results in shorter queues and reduced waiting times. Therefore, understanding and accurately calculating the arrival rate is crucial in analyzing and optimizing queueing systems.

In the next section, we will explore different models for arrival processes, starting with the Poisson process. 

### Subsection: 2.1b Modeling Arrival Process: Poisson Process

The Poisson process is a commonly used model for arrival processes in queueing theory. It is characterized by a constant arrival rate, $\lambda$, and the assumption that arrivals occur independently of each other. This means that the probability of an arrival at any given time is not affected by the previous arrivals.

The Poisson process is often used to model arrivals in systems with a large number of independent sources, such as telecommunications networks. It is also used in queuing models, as it has several interesting mathematical properties that make it a useful tool for analysis.

One of the key properties of the Poisson process is that the superposition of independent Poisson processes results in a new Poisson process with a rate equal to the sum of the rates of the individual processes. This property is particularly useful in situations where arrivals come from multiple sources.

Another important property of the Poisson process is the independent increment property, which states that the number of arrivals in any time interval is independent of the number of arrivals in any other non-overlapping time interval. This property makes the Poisson process memoryless, meaning that the probability of an arrival in the next time interval is not affected by the number of arrivals in the previous time interval.

The Poisson process can be visualized as a limiting form of the binomial distribution, where the number of trials approaches infinity and the probability of success approaches zero. This makes it a useful model for situations where arrivals are rare but can occur at any time.

In summary, the Poisson process is a powerful tool for modeling arrival processes in queueing theory. Its constant arrival rate and independent increment property make it a useful and versatile model for a wide range of systems. In the next section, we will explore other models for arrival processes and their applications in queueing theory.

### Section 2.2: Service Rate and Service Time

In this section, we will discuss the concepts of service rate and service time in queueing theory. These concepts are essential in understanding Little's Law and its generalizations, as they determine the rate at which customers are served in a queueing system.

#### 2.2a: Definition and Calculation of Service Rate

The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is defined as the average number of customers served by a queueing system per unit time. It is a crucial parameter in queueing theory, as it determines the capacity of the system to serve customers. The service rate can be calculated by dividing the total number of customers served by the total time period. For example, if a queueing system serves 50 customers in 10 minutes, the service rate would be 5 customers per minute.

The service time, on the other hand, refers to the time taken to serve a single customer. It is also known as the service duration or service completion time. The service time can vary depending on the type of service being provided and the complexity of the task. In queueing theory, the service time is often assumed to follow a probability distribution, such as the exponential distribution, which is commonly used to model service times in queueing systems.

Similar to the arrival rate, the service rate may also vary over time in some cases. This can happen due to factors such as varying customer demand or changes in the service process. In such scenarios, the service rate can be calculated by taking the average of the service rates at different time intervals.

The service rate is a critical factor in queueing systems, as it affects the performance and behavior of the system. A higher service rate leads to shorter queues and reduced waiting times, while a lower service rate results in longer queues and increased waiting times. Therefore, understanding and accurately calculating the service rate is crucial in analyzing and optimizing queueing systems.

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between arrival rate, service rate, and queueing behavior in more detail.

The service rate is a critical factor in queueing systems, as it affects the performance and behavior of the system. A higher service rate leads to shorter queues and reduced waiting times, while a lower service rate results in longer queues and increased waiting times. Therefore, understanding and accurately modeling the service rate is crucial in designing efficient queueing systems.

### Subsection 2.2b: Modeling Service Time: Exponential Distribution

In queueing theory, the service time is often modeled using probability distributions. One of the most commonly used distributions for modeling service time is the exponential distribution. This distribution is often used due to its simplicity and its ability to accurately model service times in many real-world scenarios.

The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is characterized by a single parameter, denoted by $\lambda$. This parameter represents the rate at which events occur, in this case, the rate at which customers are served. The probability density function of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}
$$

where $x$ represents the service time.

The exponential distribution has several useful properties that make it suitable for modeling service times. One of these properties is the memoryless property, which states that the probability of an event occurring in the next time interval is independent of the time that has already passed. In the context of queueing theory, this means that the probability of a customer being served in the next time interval is independent of the time they have already spent waiting in the queue.

Another important property of the exponential distribution is that it has a constant failure rate. This means that the probability of an event occurring in a given time interval is constant, regardless of how much time has already passed. In the context of queueing theory, this translates to a constant service rate, which is a desirable property for efficient queueing systems.

In conclusion, the exponential distribution is a useful tool for modeling service times in queueing systems. Its simplicity and useful properties make it a popular choice for many real-world applications. However, it is important to note that the exponential distribution may not always accurately model service times in all scenarios, and other distributions may be more suitable in certain cases.

### Section 2.3: Utilization and Queue Length

In this section, we will explore the concepts of utilization and queue length in queueing theory. These measures are crucial in understanding the performance of a queueing system and its capacity to handle customer demand.

#### 2.3a: Definition and Calculation of Utilization

Utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is defined as the ratio of the average service rate to the average arrival rate in a queueing system. It represents the percentage of time that the system is being used to serve customers. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\mu}{\lambda}
$$

where $\mu$ is the service rate and $\lambda$ is the arrival rate.

Utilization is an important measure in queueing theory as it indicates the efficiency of a system. A high utilization rate means that the system is operating at or near its maximum capacity, while a low utilization rate suggests that the system has excess capacity and is not being fully utilized.

The calculation of utilization can vary depending on the type of queueing system. In a single-server queue, the utilization can be calculated by dividing the average service time by the average interarrival time. In a multi-server queue, the utilization can be calculated by dividing the average service rate by the product of the number of servers and the average arrival rate.

It is important to note that utilization can also be affected by factors such as the variability of service times and the arrival process. In cases where the arrival rate is higher than the service rate, the utilization can exceed 100%, indicating that the system is unable to keep up with the demand.

In summary, utilization is a key measure in queueing theory that helps us understand the efficiency and capacity of a queueing system. It is influenced by various factors and can be calculated in different ways depending on the type of system.

### Section: 2.3 Utilization and Queue Length

In this section, we will explore the concepts of utilization and queue length in queueing theory. These measures are crucial in understanding the performance of a queueing system and its capacity to handle customer demand.

#### 2.3a: Definition and Calculation of Utilization

Utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is defined as the ratio of the average service rate to the average arrival rate in a queueing system. It represents the percentage of time that the system is being used to serve customers. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\mu}{\lambda}
$$

where $\mu$ is the service rate and $\lambda$ is the arrival rate.

Utilization is an important measure in queueing theory as it indicates the efficiency of a system. A high utilization rate means that the system is operating at or near its maximum capacity, while a low utilization rate suggests that the system has excess capacity and is not being fully utilized.

The calculation of utilization can vary depending on the type of queueing system. In a single-server queue, the utilization can be calculated by dividing the average service time by the average interarrival time. In a multi-server queue, the utilization can be calculated by dividing the average service rate by the product of the number of servers and the average arrival rate.

It is important to note that utilization can also be affected by factors such as the variability of service times and the arrival process. In cases where the arrival rate is higher than the service rate, the utilization can exceed 100%, indicating that the system is unable to keep up with the demand.

#### 2.3b: Relationship between Utilization and Queue Length

In addition to measuring the efficiency of a queueing system, utilization is also closely related to the queue length. The queue length, denoted by $L$, is the number of customers waiting in the queue at a given time. It is influenced by the arrival rate, service rate, and utilization of the system.

The relationship between utilization and queue length can be expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\rho^2}{1-\rho}
$$

This relationship shows that as the utilization increases, the queue length also increases. This makes intuitive sense, as a higher utilization means that more customers are being served, leading to a longer queue. However, it is important to note that this relationship is not linear and the queue length can increase exponentially as the utilization approaches 100%.

In summary, the relationship between utilization and queue length is an important concept in queueing theory. It helps us understand the impact of utilization on the performance of a queueing system and highlights the need for efficient utilization management in order to minimize queue lengths and improve overall system performance.

### Section: 2.4 Response Time and Waiting Time

In this section, we will explore the concepts of response time and waiting time in queueing theory. These measures are crucial in understanding the performance of a queueing system and its ability to handle customer demand.

#### 2.4a: Definition and Calculation of Response Time

Response time, also known as turnaround time, is the amount of time a job spends in the system from the instant of arrival to the time they leave the system. It is a key performance measure in queueing theory as it directly affects the customer experience and satisfaction.

The response time can be calculated by adding the service time and the waiting time. The service time is the time it takes for a request to be processed, while the waiting time is the time a request spends in the queue before being serviced. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
T = S + W
$$

where $T$ is the response time, $S$ is the service time, and $W$ is the waiting time.

The calculation of response time can vary depending on the type of queueing system. In a single-server queue, the response time can be calculated by adding the average service time and the average waiting time. In a multi-server queue, the response time can be calculated by adding the average service time and the average waiting time divided by the number of servers.

It is important to note that the response time can also be affected by factors such as the variability of service times and the arrival process. In cases where the arrival rate is higher than the service rate, the response time can increase significantly, leading to longer waiting times for customers.

With the use of basic queueing theory math, we can also calculate how the average waiting time increases as the system becomes busier. As the utilization increases, the average waiting time also increases in a non-linear fashion. This highlights the importance of managing the utilization of a queueing system to ensure efficient and timely service for customers.

Transmission time, which includes propagation delays and network delays, can also significantly impact the response time. As the distance between the customer and the system increases, the transmission time also increases, leading to longer response times.

In technology, response time is a crucial measure for evaluating the performance of a system or functional unit. It is often used to measure the speed and efficiency of processes such as memory fetch, disk IO, database queries, and web page loading. By understanding the factors that affect response time, we can optimize systems to provide faster and more efficient service to customers.

where $T$ is the response time, $S$ is the service time, and $W$ is the waiting time.

The calculation of response time can vary depending on the type of queueing system. In a single-server queue, the response time can be calculated by adding the average service time and the average waiting time. In a multi-server queue, the response time can be calculated by adding the average service time and the average waiting time divided by the number of servers.

It is important to note that the response time can also be affected by factors such as the variability of service times and the arrival process. In cases where the arrival rate is higher than the service rate, the response time can increase significantly, leading to longer waiting times for customers.

With the use of basic queueing theory math, we can also calculate how the average waiting time increases as the system becomes busier. As the utilization increases, the average waiting time also increases in a non-linear fashion. This can be seen in the formula for Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average response time. As the arrival rate increases, the response time also increases, leading to a larger number of customers in the system.

#### 2.4b: Estimating Waiting Time in Queueing Systems

In order to estimate the waiting time in a queueing system, we can use Buzen's algorithm. This algorithm represents the first efficient procedure for computing the normalizing constant, G(N), in the Gordon-Newell theorem. By solving for the values of X<sub>i</sub>, we can calculate the steady state probability of the number of customers at each service facility. This allows us to estimate the waiting time for each customer in the system.

Another approach to estimating waiting time is through the use of fork-join queues. In a network of fork-join queues joined in series, we can use an approximate formula to calculate the response time distribution. This can give us an estimate of the waiting time for customers in the system.

The split-merge model is a related model that can also be used to estimate waiting time. This model is similar to the fork-join model, but instead of joining queues in series, it splits them into parallel queues. By using this model, we can estimate the waiting time for customers in a parallel queueing system.

In conclusion, understanding and estimating waiting time in queueing systems is crucial for analyzing the performance of a system and improving customer satisfaction. By using various methods such as Buzen's algorithm and fork-join queues, we can estimate waiting time and make informed decisions to optimize the performance of a queueing system.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have discussed the basics of queueing theory and its applications in various fields. We have explored the different types of queues, their characteristics, and the various performance measures used to evaluate them. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of queueing theory by discussing distributional laws.

Distributional laws play a crucial role in queueing theory as they provide a framework for analyzing the behavior of queues. They help us understand the probability distribution of the arrival and service times, which are essential components in determining the performance of a queue. In this chapter, we will cover the different types of distributional laws used in queueing theory, including the Poisson, Exponential, and Erlang distributions.

We will also explore how these distributional laws can be applied to real-world scenarios. We will discuss how they can be used to model and analyze various queueing systems, such as telecommunication networks, transportation systems, and healthcare facilities. By understanding the distributional laws, we can gain insights into the behavior of these systems and make informed decisions to improve their performance.

Furthermore, we will also discuss the limitations of distributional laws and how they can be overcome by using more advanced techniques. We will explore the use of Markov chains and simulation methods to model and analyze complex queueing systems. These techniques allow us to consider more realistic scenarios and provide more accurate results.

In conclusion, this chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of distributional laws and their applications in queueing theory. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in the mathematical principles of queueing theory, which will be essential in understanding the advanced topics covered in the following chapters. 


## Chapter 3: Distributional Laws:

### Section: 3.1 Poisson Distribution:

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that is widely used in queueing theory. It is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, who first introduced it in the early 19th century. The Poisson distribution is often used to model the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space, given that these events occur independently and at a constant rate.

The Poisson distribution is defined by a single parameter, λ, which represents the average rate of events occurring in the given interval. The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:

$$
P(k;\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

where k is the number of events that occur in the interval.

#### 3.1a Definition and Properties of Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. The mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are both equal to λ. This means that the distribution is symmetric around its mean, and the spread of the distribution is determined by the value of λ.

2. The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution, meaning that the possible values of k are integers starting from 0. This makes it suitable for modeling count data, such as the number of customers in a queue or the number of arrivals at a service facility.

3. The Poisson distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the number of events that have occurred in previous intervals. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the arrival rate is constant over time.

4. The Poisson distribution is often used to approximate the binomial distribution when the number of trials is large and the probability of success is small. This is known as the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution.

5. The Poisson distribution can be used to model rare events, where the probability of an event occurring is small. This is because the Poisson distribution is skewed towards 0, making it suitable for modeling events that occur infrequently.

In queueing theory, the Poisson distribution is used to model the arrival process of customers or jobs to a queue. It is also used to model the service times of servers in a queueing system. By understanding the properties of the Poisson distribution, we can gain insights into the behavior of these systems and make informed decisions to improve their performance.

### Subsection: 3.1b Evaluating the Poisson Distribution

Computing P(k;λ) for given k and λ is a trivial task that can be accomplished by using the standard definition of the Poisson distribution. However, the conventional definition of the Poisson distribution can lead to numerical instability when λ is large. To overcome this, the Poisson probability mass function should be evaluated as:

$$
P(k;\lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!} = e^{-\lambda + k \ln{\lambda} - \ln{k!}}
$$

This formulation is mathematically equivalent but numerically stable, as it avoids the potential overflow of λ^k and the rounding error when calculating k!. The natural logarithm of the Gamma function can be used to evaluate the term ln(k!), which is available in many computing languages.

Some computing languages also provide built-in functions to evaluate the Poisson distribution, such as the `poissonpdf` function in MATLAB or the `dpois` function in R.

### Subsection: 3.1c Random Variate Generation

The Poisson distribution can also be used to generate random variates, which are integer values that follow the Poisson distribution with a given λ. This is useful for simulating queueing systems and other stochastic processes.

One simple algorithm to generate random Poisson-distributed numbers is given by Knuth:<r|Knuth1997|p=137-138>. This algorithm has a linear complexity in the returned value k, which is equal to λ on average. However, there are more efficient algorithms available, such as the acceptance-rejection method and the inversion method, which can generate random variates with a constant complexity.

In conclusion, the Poisson distribution is a fundamental distribution in queueing theory that is used to model the arrival and service processes in queueing systems. Its properties and applications make it a valuable tool for analyzing and improving the performance of these systems. In the next section, we will discuss another important distribution in queueing theory, the Exponential distribution.

This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the arrival rate is constant over time.

4. The Poisson distribution is often used to approximate the binomial distribution when the number of trials is large and the probability of success is small. This is known as the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution.

#### 3.1b Application of Poisson Distribution in Queueing Systems

The Poisson distribution has many applications in queueing systems, particularly in the analysis of arrival and service processes. In queueing theory, the M/G/1 queue is a popular model that assumes a Poisson arrival process and a general service time distribution. The waiting and response time in this queue can be calculated using the Pollaczek–Khinchine transform, which is based on the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the service time probability density function.

The arrival theorem, which states that the arrivals in a queueing system are determined by a Poisson process, also relies on the Poisson distribution. This theorem is often used to analyze the steady state behavior of queueing systems.

In addition, the Poisson distribution is also used in the M/M/c queue, where c represents the number of servers. This queueing system assumes a Poisson arrival process and an exponential service time distribution. The stationary analysis of this queue can be done using the Poisson distribution.

#### 3.1c Solving for the Steady State Probability in Closed Queueing Networks

The Poisson distribution is also used in closed queueing networks, where customers circulate among multiple service facilities. In this case, the steady state probability of the number of customers at each service facility can be calculated using the Gordon–Newell theorem. This theorem states that the steady state probability is equal to the product of the normalizing constant and the number of customers at each service facility, raised to the power of the number of customers at that facility. The values of the normalizing constant and the number of customers at each facility can be determined by solving a set of equations, known as Buzen's algorithm.

In conclusion, the Poisson distribution is a fundamental tool in queueing theory, with applications in various queueing systems and networks. Its properties and applications make it a valuable tool for analyzing and understanding the behavior of queueing systems.

### Section: 3.2 Exponential Distribution:

The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is widely used in queueing theory. It is often used to model the time between events occurring in a Poisson process, where events occur independently and at a constant rate. The exponential distribution is named as such because it follows an exponential decay pattern.

#### 3.2a Definition and Properties of Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is defined by a single parameter, β, which represents the rate parameter. The probability density function of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(x;\beta) = \beta e^{-\beta x}
$$

where x is the time between events.

The exponential distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. The mean of the exponential distribution is equal to 1/β, while the variance is equal to 1/β^2. This means that the distribution is skewed to the right, with a long tail on the positive side. The spread of the distribution is determined by the value of β.

2. The exponential distribution is a continuous distribution, meaning that the possible values of x are all positive real numbers. This makes it suitable for modeling continuous data, such as the time between arrivals at a service facility.

3. The exponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the time that has passed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the arrival rate is constant over time.

4. The exponential distribution is often used to approximate the normal distribution when the sample size is large. This is known as the central limit theorem and is a fundamental concept in statistics.

5. The exponential distribution is closely related to the Poisson distribution. In fact, if we consider the number of events occurring in a given time interval, the distribution of this number follows a Poisson distribution with a rate parameter of λ = 1/β. This relationship is known as the Poisson process.

In summary, the exponential distribution is a versatile and powerful tool in queueing theory, with many important properties that make it a valuable tool for analyzing and modeling real-world systems. In the next section, we will explore another important distribution in queueing theory - the Erlang distribution.

4. The exponential distribution is often used to approximate the normal distribution when the sample size is large. This is known as the central limit theorem and is a fundamental concept in statistics.

5. The exponential distribution is closely related to the Poisson distribution. In fact, if we consider a Poisson process with rate λ, the time between events will follow an exponential distribution with rate λ. This relationship is important in queueing theory, as it allows us to model the arrival process at a service facility using the Poisson distribution.

### Subsection: 3.2b Application of Exponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

The exponential distribution has many applications in queueing systems, particularly in the M/G/1 queue. In this type of queue, customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate λ and are served by a single server with service time following an arbitrary distribution, denoted by G. The exponential distribution is used to model the time between arrivals and the service time, making it a crucial component in analyzing the performance of the queue.

One of the main applications of the exponential distribution in queueing systems is in calculating the waiting and response times. In the M/G/1 queue, the waiting time is defined as the time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served, while the response time is the total time a customer spends in the system, including both waiting and service time. Using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, we can express the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the waiting time distribution in terms of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the service time distribution. This allows us to calculate the mean and variance of the waiting and response times, which are important metrics in evaluating the performance of a queueing system.

Another important application of the exponential distribution in queueing systems is in the arrival theorem. As mentioned earlier, the exponential distribution is closely related to the Poisson distribution. This relationship allows us to use the arrival theorem, which states that the number of arrivals in a given time interval follows a Poisson distribution with rate λ, to analyze the arrival process in a queueing system. This is particularly useful in systems where the arrival rate is not constant, as it allows us to model the arrival process using a simpler distribution.

In addition to these applications, the exponential distribution is also used in approximating the inter-departure times in the M/G/k queue with multiple servers. While many metrics for this type of queue remain an open problem, the exponential distribution provides a useful approximation for the inter-departure times, allowing us to analyze the performance of the queue more easily.

In conclusion, the exponential distribution plays a crucial role in queueing theory, providing a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of queueing systems. Its properties and applications make it an essential concept for understanding the fundamentals of queueing theory and its advanced applications.

### Section: 3.3 Erlang Distribution:

The Erlang distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is commonly used in queueing theory. It is named after the Danish mathematician Agner Krarup Erlang, who first used it to model telephone call arrival patterns. The Erlang distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution, and it is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process with a constant rate.

#### 3.3a Definition and Properties of Erlang Distribution

The Erlang distribution is defined by two parameters, k and λ, where k is the shape parameter and λ is the rate parameter. The probability density function of the Erlang distribution is given by:

$$
f(x;k,\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k x^{k-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!}
$$

where x is the time between events.

The Erlang distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. The mean of the Erlang distribution is equal to k/λ, while the variance is equal to k/λ^2. This means that the distribution is skewed to the right, with a long tail on the positive side. The spread of the distribution is determined by the values of k and λ.

2. The Erlang distribution is a continuous distribution, meaning that the possible values of x are all positive real numbers. This makes it suitable for modeling continuous data, such as the time between arrivals at a service facility.

3. The Erlang distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the time that has passed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the arrival rate is constant over time.

4. The Erlang distribution is often used to approximate the normal distribution when the sample size is large. This is known as the central limit theorem and is a fundamental concept in statistics.

5. The Erlang distribution is closely related to the Poisson distribution. In fact, if k is a positive integer, the Erlang distribution becomes a special case of the gamma distribution, which is the probability distribution of the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time in a Poisson process.

In conclusion, the Erlang distribution is a versatile and powerful tool in queueing theory, with many useful properties that make it a popular choice for modeling various real-world scenarios. In the next section, we will explore some applications of the Erlang distribution in queueing theory.

4. The Erlang distribution is often used to approximate the normal distribution when the sample size is large. This is known as the central limit theorem and is a fundamental concept in statistics.

5. The Erlang distribution is also commonly used in queueing systems to model waiting times between events. In particular, the waiting times between "k" occurrences of an event in a Poisson process are Erlang distributed. This is useful in applications such as call centers, where the Erlang distribution can be used to determine the probability of packet loss or delay.

### Subsection: 3.3b Application of Erlang Distribution in Queueing Systems

The Erlang distribution has many applications in queueing systems. One of the most common applications is in modeling the traffic load in a system. This is done by using the Erlang distribution to measure the time between incoming calls and combining it with the expected duration of the calls. This information can then be used to determine the probability of packet loss or delay in the system.

The Erlang distribution is also used in conjunction with the Erlang-B and C formulae to model the behavior of blocked calls in a queueing system. The Erlang-B formula assumes that blocked calls are immediately aborted, while the Erlang-C formula assumes that blocked calls are queued until they can be served. These formulae are still widely used in traffic modeling for applications such as call centers.

In addition to its applications in queueing systems, the Erlang distribution has also been used in other fields. For example, it has been found to be a good approximation for the age distribution of cancer incidence and the cell cycle time distribution. This is due to its ability to model events that occur independently with some average rate.

Overall, the Erlang distribution, with its various properties and applications, is a fundamental tool in queueing theory and has broad applicability beyond telephony. Its use in modeling waiting times and traffic load in queueing systems has made it an essential concept for understanding and analyzing these systems.

### Section: 3.4 Hyperexponential Distribution:

The hyperexponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is commonly used in queueing theory. It is a mixture density, meaning that it is a combination of multiple exponential distributions with different rate parameters. The probability density function of the hyperexponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \lambda_i e^{-\lambda_i x}
$$

where each $Y_i$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $\lambda_i$, and $p_i$ is the probability that $X$ will take on the form of the exponential distribution with rate $\lambda_i$. It is named the "hyper"exponential distribution since its coefficient of variation is greater than that of the exponential distribution, whose coefficient of variation is 1, and the hypoexponential distribution, which has a coefficient of variation smaller than one.

### Subsection: 3.4a Definition and Properties of Hyperexponential Distribution

The hyperexponential distribution is defined by the parameters $n$, $p_i$, and $\lambda_i$, where $n$ is the number of exponential distributions in the mixture, $p_i$ is the probability of the $i$th exponential distribution, and $\lambda_i$ is the rate parameter of the $i$th exponential distribution. The probability density function of the hyperexponential distribution can also be written as:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \lambda_i e^{-\lambda_i x} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{p_i}{\lambda_i} \lambda_i^2 e^{-\lambda_i x}
$$

This shows that the hyperexponential distribution is a weighted sum of exponential distributions, with the weights being inversely proportional to the rate parameters. This property is useful in modeling systems where the arrival rate of events follows a mixture of different exponential distributions.

The hyperexponential distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. The mean of the hyperexponential distribution is given by:

$$
E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \lambda_i^{-1}
$$

This shows that the mean is a weighted sum of the inverse of the rate parameters. This also means that the mean can be adjusted by changing the weights or the rate parameters, making the hyperexponential distribution a flexible tool for modeling different systems.

2. The variance of the hyperexponential distribution is given by:

$$
Var[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \lambda_i^{-2}
$$

This shows that the variance is also a weighted sum, but this time of the inverse of the squared rate parameters. This property is useful in determining the spread of the distribution and can be adjusted by changing the weights or the rate parameters.

3. The hyperexponential distribution is a continuous distribution, meaning that the possible values of $X$ are all positive real numbers. This makes it suitable for modeling continuous data, such as the time between arrivals at a service facility.

4. The hyperexponential distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the time that has passed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the arrival rate is constant over time.

5. The hyperexponential distribution can be used to approximate other distributions, such as the normal distribution, when the sample size is large. This is known as the central limit theorem and is a fundamental concept in statistics.

### Subsection: 3.4b Fitting the Hyperexponential Distribution

A given probability distribution, including a heavy-tailed distribution, can be approximated by a hyperexponential distribution by fitting recursively to different time scales using Prony's method or the GHK algorithm. This involves finding the best values for the parameters $n$, $p_i$, and $\lambda_i$ that minimize the difference between the hyperexponential distribution and the observed data.

The hyperexponential distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, as it allows for flexible modeling of systems with different arrival rates and can be used to approximate other distributions. Understanding its properties and how to fit it to data is essential for advanced applications in queueing theory.

f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \lambda_i e^{-\lambda_i x} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{p_i}{\lambda_i} \lambda_i^2 e^{-\lambda_i x}
$$

This shows that the hyperexponential distribution is a weighted sum of exponential distributions, with the weights being inversely proportional to the rate parameters. This property is useful in modeling systems where the arrival rate of events follows a mixture of different exponential distributions.

The hyperexponential distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties include:

- The hyperexponential distribution is a continuous distribution, meaning that it can take on any value within a given range.
- The distribution is unimodal, meaning that it has a single peak.
- The distribution is symmetric, meaning that it is equally likely to take on values above and below its mean.
- The mean of the distribution is given by the weighted average of the means of the individual exponential distributions, with the weights being the probabilities $p_i$.
- The variance of the distribution is given by the weighted sum of the variances of the individual exponential distributions, with the weights being the probabilities $p_i$.
- The coefficient of variation of the distribution is greater than 1, making it a "hyper"exponential distribution.
- The distribution is closed under convolution, meaning that the sum of two independent hyperexponential distributions is also a hyperexponential distribution.

These properties make the hyperexponential distribution a versatile tool for modeling queueing systems. It allows for the modeling of systems with varying arrival rates and service times, making it applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios.

### Subsection: 3.4b Application of Hyperexponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

The hyperexponential distribution has many applications in queueing systems. One of the most common applications is in modeling the service times of jobs in a fork-join queue. In a fork-join queue, a job is split into multiple subtasks, each of which is processed by a different server. The job is only considered complete when all subtasks have been processed.

The hyperexponential distribution is useful in this scenario because it allows for the modeling of different service times for each subtask. This is important because in real-world systems, different subtasks may require different amounts of processing time. By using a hyperexponential distribution, we can accurately model the variability in service times for each subtask.

Another application of the hyperexponential distribution is in modeling the response time of jobs in a queueing system. The response time is the total amount of time a job spends in the system, including both waiting time and service time. The hyperexponential distribution can be used to model the response time distribution when service times are exponentially distributed and jobs arrive according to a Poisson process or a general distribution.

In addition, the hyperexponential distribution can also be used to model the stationary distribution of the number of jobs at each queue in a fork-join queue. This is important for understanding the behavior of the system in the long run and can help with making decisions about resource allocation and system design.

Overall, the hyperexponential distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory and has many applications in modeling real-world systems. Its ability to handle variability in arrival rates and service times makes it a valuable tool for understanding and optimizing queueing systems.


## Chapter 3: Distributional Laws:

### Section: 3.5 General Distribution:

The general distribution is a type of probability distribution that is used to model a wide range of phenomena in queueing theory. It is a versatile distribution that can be used to approximate the behavior of complex systems, making it a valuable tool for analyzing queueing systems in real-world applications.

### Subsection: 3.5a Definition and Properties of General Distribution

The general distribution is defined by a set of parameters that describe its shape and characteristics. These parameters can vary depending on the specific application, but they typically include measures of central tendency, such as the mean and median, as well as measures of dispersion, such as the variance and standard deviation. The general distribution is often used to model systems that exhibit a wide range of behaviors, making it a flexible and powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems.

One of the key properties of the general distribution is its ability to approximate the behavior of complex systems. This is achieved by adjusting the parameters of the distribution to match the characteristics of the system being modeled. For example, if a queueing system exhibits a high degree of variability in its arrival rates, the parameters of the general distribution can be adjusted to reflect this behavior. This allows for a more accurate representation of the system and can lead to more accurate predictions and analysis.

Another important property of the general distribution is its ability to handle a wide range of data types. Unlike other distributions that are limited to specific types of data, the general distribution can be used to model both continuous and discrete data. This makes it a valuable tool for analyzing queueing systems that may involve a mix of different data types.

In addition to its flexibility and versatility, the general distribution also has several other useful properties. For example, it is a continuous distribution, meaning that it can take on any value within a given range. This makes it well-suited for modeling systems that involve continuous variables, such as arrival rates or service times. Additionally, the general distribution is often used in conjunction with other distributions, such as the hyperexponential distribution, to model more complex systems.

Overall, the general distribution is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems and has a wide range of applications in both theory and practice. Its flexibility, versatility, and ability to approximate complex systems make it an essential tool for any queueing theorist or practitioner. In the next section, we will explore the hyperexponential distribution, another important distribution used in queueing theory.

The general distribution is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of complex systems. It is a versatile distribution that can be used to model a wide range of phenomena, making it a valuable tool for analyzing queueing systems in various real-world applications.

### Subsection: 3.5b Application of General Distribution in Queueing Systems

The general distribution is widely used in queueing theory due to its ability to approximate the behavior of complex systems. In this subsection, we will explore some of the key applications of the general distribution in queueing systems.

One of the main applications of the general distribution is in modeling the arrival process in queueing systems. The arrival process is a fundamental component of queueing systems, as it determines the rate at which customers enter the system. In many real-world scenarios, the arrival process can be highly variable, making it challenging to model accurately. However, the general distribution can be adjusted to match the characteristics of the arrival process, allowing for a more accurate representation of the system.

Another important application of the general distribution is in modeling the service time in queueing systems. The service time is the amount of time it takes for a customer to be served at a particular service facility. Like the arrival process, the service time can also exhibit a high degree of variability. By adjusting the parameters of the general distribution, we can model this variability and gain a better understanding of the system's behavior.

The general distribution is also used to model the waiting and response time in queueing systems. The waiting time is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served, while the response time is the total time a customer spends in the system, including both waiting and service time. By using the Pollaczek–Khinchine transform, we can calculate the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the waiting time distribution, which is given by the service time probability density function. This allows us to analyze and optimize the waiting and response time in queueing systems.

In addition to these applications, the general distribution is also used in more complex queueing systems, such as fork-join and split-merge models. These models involve multiple service facilities and complex arrival and service processes, making them challenging to analyze. However, the general distribution can be used to approximate the behavior of these systems and provide valuable insights into their performance.

In conclusion, the general distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory that allows us to model and analyze a wide range of complex systems. Its versatility and flexibility make it an essential concept for understanding the fundamentals of queueing theory and its applications in various real-world scenarios.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of conservation laws in queueing theory. Conservation laws are fundamental principles that govern the behavior of queues and play a crucial role in understanding and analyzing queueing systems. These laws are based on the concept of conservation of flow, which states that the amount of flow entering a system must be equal to the amount of flow leaving the system. In the context of queueing theory, this translates to the idea that the number of customers entering a queue must be equal to the number of customers leaving the queue.

We will begin by discussing the basic conservation law, also known as Little's Law, which relates the average number of customers in a queue to the average waiting time and arrival rate. This law serves as the foundation for many other conservation laws and is essential in understanding the behavior of queues. We will then explore other conservation laws, such as the conservation of workload and the conservation of flow rate, and their applications in queueing theory.

Furthermore, we will discuss how conservation laws can be used to analyze and optimize queueing systems. By understanding the underlying principles of conservation laws, we can identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in a queueing system and make informed decisions to improve its performance. We will also explore how conservation laws can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as traffic flow and telecommunication networks, to solve practical problems.

In summary, this chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of conservation laws in queueing theory, their applications, and their significance in understanding and optimizing queueing systems. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of queues and how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. 


## Chapter 4: Conservation Laws:

### Section: 4.1 Traffic Intensity:

Traffic intensity is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that measures the average occupancy of a server or resource during a specified period of time. It is a crucial parameter in understanding and analyzing queueing systems, as it directly affects the performance and efficiency of the system.

In telecommunication networks, traffic intensity is commonly measured in traffic units, also known as erlangs. It is defined as the ratio of the time during which a facility is cumulatively occupied to the time this facility is available for occupancy. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{A}{T}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the traffic intensity, $A$ is the average arrival rate of customers, and $T$ is the average service time.

A traffic intensity greater than one erlang indicates that the rate at which customers arrive exceeds the rate at which they can be served, resulting in queuing delays and potential congestion. On the other hand, a traffic intensity less than one erlang means that the system has spare capacity and can handle more average traffic.

Telecommunication operators are highly interested in traffic intensity as it directly affects the amount of equipment they must supply to meet the demand. By accurately calculating and monitoring traffic intensity, operators can make informed decisions to optimize their network and improve its performance.

### Subsection: 4.1a Definition and Calculation of Traffic Intensity

To calculate traffic intensity, we must first determine the average arrival rate and average service time. The average arrival rate can be calculated by dividing the total number of arrivals by the total time period. Similarly, the average service time can be calculated by dividing the total service time by the total number of customers served.

For example, if a telecommunication network has 1000 arrivals in a one-hour period and the total service time for these customers is 500 hours, the traffic intensity can be calculated as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{1000}{500} = 2 \text{ erlangs}
$$

This means that the network is operating at a traffic intensity of 2 erlangs, indicating that it may experience queuing delays and congestion.

In addition to its application in telecommunication networks, traffic intensity is also used in other fields such as traffic flow analysis. In traffic engineering, it is used to measure the average occupancy of a road or highway, which can help identify bottlenecks and optimize traffic flow.

In conclusion, traffic intensity is a crucial parameter in queueing theory that measures the average occupancy of a server or resource. It is used to analyze and optimize queueing systems and has applications in various fields, making it a fundamental concept in the study of queues.

The average arrival rate can be calculated by dividing the total number of arrivals by the total time period. Similarly, the average service time can be calculated by dividing the total service time by the total number of customers served.

For example, if a telecommunication network has 1000 arrivals in a one-hour period and the total service time for those arrivals is 2000 minutes, the average arrival rate would be 1000 arrivals per hour and the average service time would be 2 minutes per arrival. This would result in a traffic intensity of 1000/60 = 16.67 erlangs.

### Subsection: 4.1b Relationship between Traffic Intensity and System Performance

The relationship between traffic intensity and system performance is a crucial aspect of queueing theory. As mentioned earlier, a traffic intensity greater than one erlang indicates that the system is experiencing congestion and delays, while a traffic intensity less than one erlang means that the system has spare capacity.

In general, as traffic intensity increases, the average waiting time for customers also increases. This is because as more customers arrive, the system becomes more congested and it takes longer for each customer to be served. This can lead to dissatisfied customers and a decrease in overall system performance.

On the other hand, when traffic intensity is low, the system has spare capacity and customers experience shorter waiting times. This can lead to higher customer satisfaction and better system performance.

It is important for telecommunication operators to carefully monitor and manage traffic intensity in order to optimize their network and provide the best possible service to their customers. By understanding the relationship between traffic intensity and system performance, operators can make informed decisions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their network. 


## Chapter 4: Conservation Laws:

### Section: 4.2 Balance Equation:

The balance equation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that is used to describe the flow of customers through a system. It is based on the principle of conservation of mass, which states that the mass that enters a system must either leave the system or accumulate within the system. In the context of queueing theory, this means that the number of customers entering a system must either be served or remain in the system.

### Subsection: 4.2a Definition and Concept of Balance Equation

The balance equation can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = \lambda - \mu N
$$

where $\frac{dN}{dt}$ is the rate of change of the number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate of customers, and $\mu$ is the service rate of the system.

This equation is known as the balance equation because it represents a balance between the rate at which customers enter the system and the rate at which they are served. If the arrival rate is greater than the service rate, the number of customers in the system will increase, and vice versa.

The balance equation can also be applied to individual servers within a system. In this case, the equation becomes:

$$
\frac{dN_i}{dt} = \lambda_i - \mu_i N_i
$$

where $\frac{dN_i}{dt}$ is the rate of change of the number of customers at server $i$, $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate of customers at server $i$, and $\mu_i$ is the service rate of server $i$.

This modified equation can be used to analyze the performance of individual servers within a system and identify potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement.

In the absence of a chemical reaction, the balance equation simplifies to:

$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = \lambda - \mu N
$$

This equation is commonly used in queueing theory to model systems without any chemical reactions, such as telecommunication networks or manufacturing processes.

Overall, the balance equation is a powerful tool in queueing theory that allows us to understand and analyze the flow of customers through a system. By accurately calculating and monitoring the arrival and service rates, we can make informed decisions to optimize the performance and efficiency of a system.

### Subsection: 4.2b Application of Balance Equation in Queueing Systems

The balance equation is a powerful tool in queueing theory that can be applied in various ways to analyze and improve the performance of queueing systems. In this subsection, we will explore some of the applications of the balance equation in queueing systems.

#### 4.2b.1 Analysis of System Performance

One of the main applications of the balance equation is in analyzing the performance of queueing systems. By using the balance equation, we can determine the rate of change of the number of customers in the system, which is a key factor in understanding the behavior of the system.

For example, if the arrival rate is greater than the service rate, the number of customers in the system will increase, leading to longer wait times and potentially causing congestion. On the other hand, if the service rate is greater than the arrival rate, the number of customers in the system will decrease, resulting in shorter wait times and improved system performance.

#### 4.2b.2 Identifying Bottlenecks

The balance equation can also be used to identify potential bottlenecks in a queueing system. By analyzing the rate of change of the number of customers at individual servers, we can pinpoint which servers are experiencing high demand and may be causing delays in the system.

This information can then be used to optimize the system by either increasing the service rate at bottleneck servers or redistributing the workload to other servers.

#### 4.2b.3 Modeling Systems without Chemical Reactions

In the absence of a chemical reaction, the balance equation simplifies to:

$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = \lambda - \mu N
$$

This equation is commonly used in queueing theory to model systems without any chemical reactions, such as telecommunication networks or manufacturing processes. By using this simplified equation, we can still apply the principles of the balance equation to analyze and improve the performance of these systems.

Overall, the balance equation is a versatile tool that can be applied in various ways to analyze and optimize queueing systems. By understanding the flow of customers through a system and using the balance equation, we can improve the efficiency and performance of queueing systems in a wide range of applications.

## Chapter 4: Conservation Laws:

### Section: 4.3 Network Flow Conservation:

### Subsection (optional): 4.3a Definition and Principles of Network Flow Conservation

The concept of network flow conservation is a fundamental principle in queueing theory that is used to analyze the flow of customers through a network of interconnected nodes and edges. It is based on the principle of conservation of mass, which states that the amount of flow entering a node must either leave the node or accumulate within the node. In the context of queueing theory, this means that the number of customers entering a system must either be served or remain in the system.

#### 4.3a.1 Definition of Network Flow Conservation

In a network flow problem, we are given a flow network <math>\,G(V,E)</math>, where edge <math>(u,v) \in E</math> has a capacity <math>\,c(u,v)</math>. The network also consists of <math>\,k</math> commodities <math>K_1,K_2,\dots,K_k</math>, defined by <math>\,K_i=(s_i,t_i,d_i)</math>, where <math>\,s_i</math> and <math>\,t_i</math> are the source and sink nodes of commodity <math>\,i</math>, and <math>\,d_i</math> is its demand. The variable <math>\,f_i(u,v)</math> represents the fraction of flow <math>\,i</math> along edge <math>\,(u,v)</math>, where <math>\,f_i(u,v) \in [0,1]</math> if the flow can be split among multiple paths, and <math>\,f_i(u,v) \in \{0,1\}</math> if the flow can only take a single path (i.e. "single path routing").

#### 4.3a.2 Principles of Network Flow Conservation

The principles of network flow conservation can be summarized by four constraints:

(1) Link capacity: The sum of all flows routed over a link cannot exceed its capacity.

(2) Flow conservation on transit nodes: The amount of flow entering an intermediate node <math>u</math> must be equal to the amount of flow exiting the node.

(3) Flow conservation at the source: A flow must exit its source node completely.

(4) Flow conservation at the destination: A flow must enter its sink node completely.

These constraints ensure that the flow of customers through the network is balanced and that no nodes or edges become overloaded.

### Related Optimization Problems

The concept of network flow conservation can be applied to various optimization problems in queueing theory. Some common examples include:

#### 4.3a.1 Load Balancing

Load balancing is the process of routing flows in a network such that the utilization <math>U(u,v)</math> of all links <math>(u,v)\in E</math> is evenly distributed. This can be achieved by minimizing the sum of squared utilizations, <math>\sum_{u,v\in V} (U(u,v))^2</math>, or by minimizing the maximum utilization, <math>U_{max}</math>.

#### 4.3a.2 Minimum Cost Multi-commodity Flow Problem

In this problem, there is a cost <math>a(u,v) \cdot f(u,v)</math> associated with sending a flow on edge <math>(u,v)</math>. The goal is to minimize the total cost of routing all commodities from their sources to their sinks.

#### 4.3a.3 Maximum Multi-commodity Flow Problem

In this problem, the demand of each commodity is not fixed, and the total throughput of the network must be maximized. This can be achieved by finding the optimal routing of flows through the network.

In conclusion, the principles of network flow conservation are essential in understanding and optimizing the flow of customers through a network. By applying these principles to various optimization problems, we can improve the performance and efficiency of queueing systems.


# Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications:

## Chapter 4: Conservation Laws:

### Section: 4.3 Network Flow Conservation:

### Subsection (optional): 4.3b Analyzing Network Flow Conservation in Queueing Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the definition and principles of network flow conservation in queueing systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of network flow conservation and its applications in queueing theory.

#### 4.3b.1 Analyzing Network Flow Conservation

The analysis of network flow conservation in queueing systems involves studying the flow of customers through a network of interconnected nodes and edges. This can be done using various mathematical models and algorithms, such as the byte-weighted fair queuing algorithm discussed in the previous section.

One approach to analyzing network flow conservation is through the use of virtual time. As mentioned before, virtual time is an alternate monotonically increasing timescale that accurately models the order in which transmissions must occur to meet the objectives of the full-featured model. By using virtual time, we can reduce the computational load of modeling actual finish times for each packet, making the analysis more feasible.

Another approach is through the use of heavy-tailed distributions, such as the Weibull distribution. These distributions take into account long-range dependencies and self-similarity in network traffic, making them more accurate in modeling real-world scenarios. By incorporating these distributions into our analysis, we can better understand the behavior of network flow conservation in queueing systems.

#### 4.3b.2 Applications of Network Flow Conservation in Queueing Theory

The principles of network flow conservation have various applications in queueing theory. One of the most common applications is in the design and optimization of network traffic models. By understanding the flow of customers through a network, we can design more efficient and fair queuing algorithms, as well as predict and prevent potential bottlenecks in the system.

Another application is in the analysis of network performance. By studying the flow of customers through a network, we can identify areas of congestion and improve the overall performance of the system. This is especially important in high-traffic networks, where even small improvements in performance can have a significant impact.

#### 4.3b.3 Challenges and Future Directions

While network flow conservation is a fundamental principle in queueing theory, there are still many challenges and areas for future research. One challenge is the accurate modeling of real-world scenarios, as network traffic can be highly unpredictable and complex. Another challenge is the scalability of algorithms and models, as networks continue to grow in size and complexity.

In the future, we can expect to see advancements in the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve the analysis and optimization of network flow conservation in queueing systems. Additionally, with the rise of new technologies such as 5G and the Internet of Things, there will be a need for new and innovative approaches to studying and managing network flow conservation. 


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we explored the concept of conservation laws in queueing theory. We learned that these laws are fundamental principles that govern the behavior of queues and can be used to analyze and optimize queueing systems. We started by discussing Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a queue is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time spent in the system. We then moved on to explore the conservation of flow, which states that the total arrival rate to a system is equal to the total departure rate. Finally, we discussed the conservation of workload, which states that the total workload in a system is equal to the total arrival rate multiplied by the average time spent in the system.

By understanding these conservation laws, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of queueing systems and make informed decisions to improve their performance. These laws can also serve as a basis for more advanced queueing models and applications. It is important to note that while these laws may seem simple, they have significant implications and can be applied to a wide range of real-world scenarios.

### Exercises

Consider a single-server queueing system with an arrival rate of 10 customers per hour and a service rate of 5 customers per hour. Use Little's Law to calculate the average number of customers in the system.

#### Exercise 2
In a multi-server queueing system, the total arrival rate is 20 customers per hour and the total departure rate is 25 customers per hour. Use the conservation of flow to determine the number of servers in the system.

#### Exercise 3
A queueing system has an average arrival rate of 50 customers per hour and an average service time of 2 minutes per customer. Use the conservation of workload to calculate the average number of customers in the system.

#### Exercise 4
In a network of queues, the total arrival rate to a particular queue is 100 customers per hour and the total departure rate is 80 customers per hour. Use the conservation of flow to determine the arrival rate to another queue in the network.

#### Exercise 5
A queueing system has an average arrival rate of 20 customers per hour and an average service time of 3 minutes per customer. Use Little's Law to calculate the average time a customer spends in the system.

Finally, we discussed the conservation of workload, which states that the total workload in a system is equal to the total arrival rate multiplied by the average time spent in the system.

By understanding these conservation laws, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of queueing systems and make informed decisions to improve their performance. These laws can also serve as a basis for more advanced queueing models and applications. It is important to note that while these laws may seem simple, they have significant implications and can be applied to a wide range of real-world scenarios.

#### Exercise 3

#### Exercise 4
In a network of queues, the total arrival rate to a particular queue is 100 customers per hour and the total departure rate is 80 customers per hour. Use the conservation of flow to determine the arrival rate to another queue in the network.

#### Exercise 5
A queueing system has an average arrival rate of 20 customers per hour and an average service time of 3 minutes per customer. Use Little's Law to calculate the average time a customer spends in the system.

### Introduction:

In the previous chapters, we have covered the basics of queueing theory, including the fundamental concepts and models. We have also explored various applications of queueing theory in real-world scenarios. In this chapter, we will delve into a specific concept known as PASTA, which stands for "Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages." PASTA is a fundamental property of queueing systems that has significant implications in the analysis and design of queueing models. In this chapter, we will discuss the concept of PASTA in detail and explore its applications in various queueing systems.

PASTA is a property that describes the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system. It states that the arrivals to a queueing system follow a Poisson process and that the time averages of the arrivals are equal to the long-run averages. This property is essential in queueing theory as it allows us to make simplifying assumptions and derive analytical results for complex queueing models. In this chapter, we will explore the implications of PASTA in various queueing systems and how it can be used to analyze and optimize these systems.

The chapter will be divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of PASTA. We will begin by discussing the fundamental concepts of PASTA and its implications in queueing systems. We will then explore the mathematical formulation of PASTA and how it can be applied to different types of arrivals, such as Poisson and non-Poisson arrivals. We will also discuss the limitations of PASTA and how it can be extended to more complex queueing systems.

Furthermore, we will explore the applications of PASTA in various queueing models, such as single-server queues, multi-server queues, and networks of queues. We will also discuss how PASTA can be used to analyze the performance of these systems and optimize their design. Finally, we will conclude the chapter by discussing the future directions and potential research areas related to PASTA in queueing theory.

### Section: 5.1 Probability of Arrival:

In queueing theory, the concept of PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) plays a crucial role in the analysis and design of queueing models. PASTA is a property that describes the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system, stating that the arrivals follow a Poisson process and that the time averages of the arrivals are equal to the long-run averages. In this section, we will define and calculate the probability of arrival, which is a fundamental concept in PASTA.

#### Definition and Calculation of Probability of Arrival

The probability of arrival, denoted as <math>\lambda</math>, is defined as the average number of arrivals per unit time in a queueing system. It is a key parameter in the Poisson process, which is a fundamental concept in PASTA. The probability of arrival can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\text{Total number of arrivals}}{\text{Total time period}}
$$

For example, if a queueing system has 100 arrivals in a time period of 10 minutes, the probability of arrival would be <math>\lambda = \frac{100}{10} = 10</math> arrivals per minute.

#### Example 1

Consider a single-server queueing system where customers arrive at a rate of 5 customers per hour. What is the probability of arrival in this system?

Using the formula, we can calculate the probability of arrival as <math>\lambda = \frac{5}{1} = 5</math> arrivals per hour.

#### Example 2

Suppose we have a network of queues with three servers, and the total number of arrivals in a time period of 2 hours is 200. What is the probability of arrival in this system?

Using the formula, we can calculate the probability of arrival as <math>\lambda = \frac{200}{2} = 100</math> arrivals per hour.

In both examples, we can see that the probability of arrival is a measure of the average number of arrivals per unit time in a queueing system. This parameter is essential in understanding the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system and is a key component in the concept of PASTA.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have defined and calculated the probability of arrival, which is a fundamental concept in PASTA. The probability of arrival is a measure of the average number of arrivals per unit time in a queueing system and plays a crucial role in the analysis and design of queueing models. In the next section, we will explore the mathematical formulation of PASTA and its applications in different types of arrivals.

### Subsection: 5.1b Understanding Arrival Patterns in Queueing Systems

In addition to calculating the probability of arrival, it is also important to understand the patterns of arrivals in a queueing system. This can help in designing and optimizing the system for better performance. In this subsection, we will discuss some common arrival patterns in queueing systems.

#### Poisson Process

As mentioned earlier, the arrivals in a queueing system are often modeled as a Poisson process. This means that the arrivals occur randomly and independently of each other, with a constant average rate. The Poisson process is a fundamental concept in PASTA and is used to analyze and design various queueing models.

#### Arrival Theorem

The arrival theorem states that the arrivals in a queueing system are determined by a Poisson process. This theorem holds true for many real-world systems, making it a useful tool in queueing theory.

#### Multiple Servers

In some queueing systems, there may be multiple servers serving the customers. In such cases, the analysis of the system becomes more complex, and many metrics remain an open problem. However, some approximations and bounds are known, and Buzen's algorithm is often used to compute the values of these metrics.

#### Problem Setup

Consider a closed queueing network with "M" service facilities and "N" circulating customers. The service time for a customer at service facility "i" is given by an exponentially distributed random variable with parameter "μ"<sub>"i"</sub>. After completing service at service facility "i", a customer will proceed next to service facility "j" with probability "p"<sub>"ij"</sub>. This setup is commonly used in queueing theory to model real-world systems.

#### Gordon-Newell Theorem

The Gordon-Newell theorem states that the steady-state probability of the number of customers at each service facility in a closed queueing network can be calculated using the following formula:

<math>\mathbb P(n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_M) = \frac{1}{\text{G}(N)}\prod_{i=1}^M \left( X_i \right)^{n_i}</math>

where <math>\mathbb P(n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_M) </math> is the steady-state probability that the number of customers at service facility "i" is equal to "n<sub>i</sub>" for "i" = 1, 2, ... , "M ." The values of "X"<sub>"i"</sub> are determined by solving the equation <math>\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}\quad\text{ for }j=1,\ldots,M.</math> This theorem is useful in analyzing closed queueing networks and can help in understanding the behavior of arrivals in such systems.

#### Fork-Join Queue

A fork-join queue is a type of queueing system where customers can join multiple queues and then merge back into a single queue. This type of system is commonly used in networks of queues and can be analyzed using queueing theory.

#### Networks of Fork-Join Queues

In a network of fork-join queues, customers can join multiple queues and then merge back into a single queue. This type of system is commonly used to model real-world systems, and the analysis of such systems can be complex. However, with the help of queueing theory, we can understand the behavior of arrivals in these systems and optimize their performance.

In conclusion, understanding the patterns of arrivals in a queueing system is crucial in designing and optimizing the system for better performance. The probability of arrival, along with other concepts such as the Poisson process and the arrival theorem, play a key role in analyzing and designing queueing models. In the next section, we will discuss the Pollaczek-Khinchine transform, which is used to calculate the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the waiting time distribution in queueing systems.

### Section: 5.2 Probability of Service:

In queueing theory, the concept of PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) plays a crucial role in the analysis and design of queueing models. PASTA is a property that describes the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system, stating that the arrivals follow a Poisson process and that the time averages of the arrivals are equal to the long-run averages. In this section, we will discuss the probability of service, which is a key parameter in PASTA.

#### Definition and Calculation of Probability of Service

The probability of service, denoted as <math>\mu</math>, is defined as the average number of customers served per unit time in a queueing system. It is a fundamental concept in PASTA and is closely related to the probability of arrival. The probability of service can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\mu = \frac{\text{Total number of customers served}}{\text{Total time period}}
$$

For example, if a queueing system serves 50 customers in a time period of 10 minutes, the probability of service would be <math>\mu = \frac{50}{10} = 5</math> customers per minute.

#### Example 1

Consider a single-server queueing system where customers are served at a rate of 10 customers per hour. What is the probability of service in this system?

Using the formula, we can calculate the probability of service as <math>\mu = \frac{10}{1} = 10</math> customers per hour.

#### Example 2

Suppose we have a network of queues with three servers, and the total number of customers served in a time period of 2 hours is 300. What is the probability of service in this system?

Using the formula, we can calculate the probability of service as <math>\mu = \frac{300}{2} = 150</math> customers per hour.

In both examples, we can see that the probability of service is a measure of the average number of customers served per unit time in a queueing system. This parameter is crucial in understanding the behavior of a queueing system and is used in various queueing models and algorithms.

### Subsection: 5.2a Definition and Calculation of Probability of Service

In this subsection, we will discuss the definition and calculation of the probability of service in more detail. As mentioned earlier, the probability of service is closely related to the probability of arrival and is a key parameter in PASTA. It is used to determine the behavior of a queueing system and is essential in the analysis and design of queueing models.

#### Definition of Probability of Service

The probability of service, denoted as <math>\mu</math>, is defined as the average number of customers served per unit time in a queueing system. It is a measure of the efficiency of a queueing system and is influenced by various factors such as the number of servers, service times, and arrival rates. In a queueing system with "M" service facilities, the probability of service at facility "i" is given by an exponentially distributed random variable with parameter <math>\mu_i</math>.

#### Calculation of Probability of Service

The probability of service can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\mu = \frac{\text{Total number of customers served}}{\text{Total time period}}
$$

This formula is similar to the one used for calculating the probability of arrival, but instead of arrivals, we consider the number of customers served. In a single-server queueing system, the probability of service is equal to the arrival rate, as the server can only serve one customer at a time. However, in a multi-server system, the probability of service is influenced by the number of servers and their individual service rates.

#### Example 1

Consider a single-server queueing system where customers arrive at a rate of 5 customers per hour and are served at a rate of 10 customers per hour. What is the probability of service in this system?

Using the formula, we can calculate the probability of service as <math>\mu = \frac{10}{1} = 10</math> customers per hour. This is equal to the arrival rate, as the server can serve all arriving customers.

#### Example 2

Suppose we have a network of queues with three servers, and the total number of customers served in a time period of 2 hours is 300. What is the probability of service in this system?

Using the formula, we can calculate the probability of service as <math>\mu = \frac{300}{2} = 150</math> customers per hour. This value is influenced by the number of servers and their individual service rates, and is not necessarily equal to the arrival rate.

In conclusion, the probability of service is a crucial parameter in understanding the behavior of a queueing system. It is used in various queueing models and algorithms and is closely related to the probability of arrival. By calculating the probability of service, we can gain insights into the efficiency of a queueing system and make informed decisions in its design and analysis.

In both examples, we can see that the probability of service is a measure of the average number of customers served per unit time in a queueing system. This is an important parameter to consider when analyzing queueing systems, as it directly affects the overall performance and efficiency of the system.

### Subsection: 5.2b Analyzing Service Patterns in Queueing Systems

In addition to the probability of service, it is also important to analyze the service patterns in queueing systems. This involves understanding how customers are served and the impact it has on the overall system performance.

One common service pattern in queueing systems is event-driven messaging. This design pattern involves an event manager that registers events from service providers and notifies registered service consumers when an event occurs. This decouples the service consumers from the service providers and increases the reliability of the system.

Another important service pattern is the fork-join queue, where a job is split into "N" sub-tasks that are serviced in parallel. This can lead to a slower response time on average, but it is useful for handling complex tasks in a more efficient manner.

Analyzing service patterns in queueing systems can help identify potential bottlenecks and improve the overall performance of the system. It is an important aspect of queueing theory and should be considered when designing and analyzing queueing models.

## Chapter 5: PASTA:

### Section: 5.3 Probability of Time Average:

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of probability of service, which is a key parameter in PASTA. In this section, we will delve deeper into PASTA and explore the probability of time average, which is another important aspect of this property.

#### Definition and Calculation of Probability of Time Average

The probability of time average, denoted as <math>P_{TA}</math>, is defined as the probability that the time average of arrivals in a queueing system is equal to the long-run average. In other words, it is the probability that the average number of arrivals in a given time period is equal to the average number of arrivals in the long run. This concept is closely related to the probability of service, as it also takes into account the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system.

To calculate the probability of time average, we can use the following formula:

$$
P_{TA} = \frac{\text{Probability of service}}{\text{Probability of arrival}}
$$

This formula shows that the probability of time average is dependent on both the probability of service and the probability of arrival. It is important to note that in order for PASTA to hold, the probability of time average must be equal to 1.

#### Example 1

Consider a single-server queueing system where customers arrive at a rate of 5 customers per hour and are served at a rate of 10 customers per hour. What is the probability of time average in this system?

Using the formula, we can calculate the probability of time average as <math>P_{TA} = \frac{10}{5} = 2</math>. This means that there is a 2 out of 5 chance that the time average of arrivals will be equal to the long-run average.

#### Example 2

Suppose we have a network of queues with two servers, and the probability of service is 0.8 while the probability of arrival is 0.5. What is the probability of time average in this system?

Using the formula, we can calculate the probability of time average as <math>P_{TA} = \frac{0.8}{0.5} = 1.6</math>. This means that there is a 1.6 out of 2 chance that the time average of arrivals will be equal to the long-run average.

In both examples, we can see that the probability of time average is a measure of the likelihood that the time average of arrivals will be equal to the long-run average. This concept is crucial in understanding the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system and is a fundamental aspect of PASTA.

### Subsection: 5.3a Definition and Calculation of Probability of Time Average

In this subsection, we will further explore the definition and calculation of the probability of time average. As mentioned earlier, PASTA is a property that describes the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system. It states that the arrivals follow a Poisson process and that the time averages of the arrivals are equal to the long-run averages. Let's take a closer look at how this property is calculated.

#### Calculation of Probability of Time Average

To calculate the probability of time average, we need to first understand the concept of auto-covariance function. The auto-covariance function, denoted as <math>R_x(t,\tau)</math>, is a measure of the correlation between two random variables at different time intervals. In the context of queueing theory, it represents the correlation between the number of arrivals at time <math>t+\tau/2</math> and the number of arrivals at time <math>t-\tau/2</math>.

Using the auto-covariance function, we can calculate the probability of time average as follows:

$$
P_{TA} = \frac{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_x(t,\tau)\cdot e^{-j2\pi f\tau}\cdot d\tau}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_x(\tau)\cdot e^{-j2\pi f\tau}\cdot d\tau}
$$

This formula shows that the probability of time average is dependent on the auto-covariance function and the frequency <math>f</math>. It also highlights the importance of understanding the correlation between arrivals in a queueing system.

#### Example 3

Consider a single-server queueing system where customers arrive at a rate of 5 customers per hour and are served at a rate of 10 customers per hour. Using the auto-covariance function, calculate the probability of time average in this system.

Using the formula, we can calculate the auto-covariance function as <math>R_x(t,\tau) = E[x(t+\tau/2)x^*(t-\tau/2)] = 0</math> for any <math>t</math>. This means that the probability of time average is equal to 0, indicating that the time average of arrivals is not equal to the long-run average.

#### Example 4

Suppose we have a network of queues with three servers, and the total number of customers served in a time period of 2 hours is 300. Using the auto-covariance function, calculate the probability of time average in this system.

Using the formula, we can calculate the auto-covariance function as <math>R_x(t,\tau) = E[x(t+\tau/2)x^*(t-\tau/2)] = 150</math>. This means that the probability of time average is equal to 1, indicating that the time average of arrivals is equal to the long-run average.

In both examples, we can see the importance of the auto-covariance function in calculating the probability of time average and understanding the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system. This further emphasizes the significance of PASTA in queueing theory and its applications in real-world scenarios.

#### Estimating Time Averages in Queueing Systems

In order to estimate the time averages in queueing systems, we can use Buzen's algorithm. This algorithm represents the first efficient procedure for computing the normalizing constant, G("N"), in the Gordon-Newell theorem. By solving the equation <math>\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}</math>, we can determine the values of "X"<sub>"i"</sub> and use them to calculate the probability of time average.

#### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the concept of probability of time average in queueing systems. We have seen that it is dependent on both the probability of service and the probability of arrival, and that it must be equal to 1 for PASTA to hold. We have also learned about Buzen's algorithm, which can be used to estimate time averages in queueing systems. In the next section, we will discuss the concept of Little's Law and its applications in queueing theory.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of systems with no overtaking in queueing theory. This refers to systems where the order in which customers arrive is the same as the order in which they are served. This may seem like a simple concept, but it has important implications for the analysis and modeling of queueing systems. We will discuss the fundamentals of systems with no overtaking, including the assumptions and characteristics that define them. From there, we will delve into exact solutions for these systems, which provide a deeper understanding of their behavior and performance. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of systems with no overtaking and how they can be applied in various real-world scenarios.


### Section: 6.1 FIFO Queueing System:

The FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, where the first customer to arrive is the first to be served. This system is also known as the first-come-first-served (FCFS) system. In this section, we will define and analyze the FIFO queueing system, discussing its assumptions, characteristics, and performance.

#### 6.1a Definition and Analysis of FIFO Queueing System

The FIFO queueing system is a single-server queueing system, where customers arrive at a single queue and are served in the order of their arrival. This system is commonly used in real-world scenarios, such as supermarkets, banks, and call centers. The FIFO system follows the principle of fairness, where customers are served in the order they arrived, ensuring that no customer is unfairly prioritized over others.

To analyze the performance of the FIFO queueing system, we will use the notation introduced in Chapter 2. Let $N(t)$ be the number of customers in the system at time $t$, $A(t)$ be the number of arrivals up to time $t$, and $D(t)$ be the number of departures up to time $t$. The arrival rate is denoted by $\lambda$ and the service rate by $\mu$. We assume that the arrival process is Poisson with rate $\lambda$ and the service time follows an exponential distribution with mean $1/\mu$.

The key characteristic of the FIFO queueing system is that it has no overtaking, meaning that the order in which customers are served is the same as the order in which they arrived. This can be seen by considering the virtual time concept introduced in the related context. In the FIFO system, the virtual time is equivalent to the real time, as there is no need to recompute the finish time for previously queued packets. This simplifies the analysis of the system, as we do not need to consider the order in which customers are served.

Using Little's Law, we can derive the average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$, as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $W$ is the average waiting time in the system. Similarly, the average number of customers in the queue, denoted by $L_q$, can be derived as:

$$
L_q = \lambda W_q
$$

where $W_q$ is the average waiting time in the queue. These equations hold true for any queueing system, not just the FIFO system.

To further analyze the performance of the FIFO system, we can use the M/M/1 queueing model, where the arrival process is Poisson and the service time follows an exponential distribution. In this model, the average waiting time in the system, $W$, can be derived as:

$$
W = \frac{\rho}{\mu(1-\rho)}
$$

where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ is the utilization factor. Similarly, the average waiting time in the queue, $W_q$, can be derived as:

$$
W_q = \frac{\rho^2}{\mu(1-\rho)}
$$

These equations provide a deeper understanding of the performance of the FIFO queueing system. We can see that as the utilization factor increases, the average waiting time in the system and queue also increase. This highlights the importance of managing the arrival and service rates to ensure efficient performance of the system.

In conclusion, the FIFO queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, where customers are served in the order of their arrival. This system has no overtaking, simplifying the analysis and providing a fair distribution of service to customers. By using the M/M/1 queueing model, we can derive equations for the average waiting time in the system and queue, providing insights into the performance of the FIFO system. In the next section, we will explore the M/G/1 queueing model, which allows for more general service time distributions.


### Section: 6.1 FIFO Queueing System:

The FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, where the first customer to arrive is the first to be served. This system is also known as the first-come-first-served (FCFS) system. In this section, we will define and analyze the FIFO queueing system, discussing its assumptions, characteristics, and performance.

#### 6.1a Definition and Analysis of FIFO Queueing System

The FIFO queueing system is a single-server queueing system, where customers arrive at a single queue and are served in the order of their arrival. This system is commonly used in real-world scenarios, such as supermarkets, banks, and call centers. The FIFO system follows the principle of fairness, where customers are served in the order they arrived, ensuring that no customer is unfairly prioritized over others.

To analyze the performance of the FIFO queueing system, we will use the notation introduced in Chapter 2. Let $N(t)$ be the number of customers in the system at time $t$, $A(t)$ be the number of arrivals up to time $t$, and $D(t)$ be the number of departures up to time $t$. The arrival rate is denoted by $\lambda$ and the service rate by $\mu$. We assume that the arrival process is Poisson with rate $\lambda$ and the service time follows an exponential distribution with mean $1/\mu$.

The key characteristic of the FIFO queueing system is that it has no overtaking, meaning that the order in which customers are served is the same as the order in which they arrived. This can be seen by considering the virtual time concept introduced in the related context. In the FIFO system, the virtual time is equivalent to the real time, as there is no need to recompute the finish time for previously queued packets. This simplifies the analysis of the system, as we do not need to consider the order in which customers are served.

Using Little's Law, we can derive the average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$. Little's Law states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. In the case of the FIFO queueing system, the average time a customer spends in the system is equal to the average waiting time plus the average service time. Therefore, we can express $L$ as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot (W + \frac{1}{\mu})
$$

where $W$ is the average waiting time and $\frac{1}{\mu}$ is the average service time.

To further analyze the performance of the FIFO queueing system, we can also calculate the average waiting time, denoted by $W$. Using Little's Law again, we can express $W$ as:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda} - \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

Substituting the expression for $L$ from above, we get:

$$
W = \frac{\lambda \cdot (W + \frac{1}{\mu})}{\lambda} - \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

Solving for $W$, we get:

$$
W = \frac{\frac{1}{\mu}}{1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu}}
$$

This expression for $W$ is known as the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, and it gives us the average waiting time for the FIFO queueing system. We can also use this formula to calculate the average queue length, denoted by $L_q$, which is the average number of customers waiting in the queue. $L_q$ can be expressed as:

$$
L_q = \frac{\lambda \cdot W}{1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu}}
$$

In addition to the average waiting time and queue length, we can also calculate the average waiting time in the queue, denoted by $W_q$, and the average waiting time in the system, denoted by $W_s$. $W_q$ is the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue, while $W_s$ is the average time a customer spends in the system, including both waiting and service time. These can be expressed as:

$$
W_q = \frac{\lambda \cdot W}{\mu (1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu})}
$$

$$
W_s = \frac{1}{\mu (1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu})}
$$

In summary, the FIFO queueing system is a simple yet important concept in queueing theory. Its key characteristic of no overtaking allows for a simplified analysis, and its performance measures can be calculated using Little's Law and the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula. In the next subsection, we will discuss the performance measures in more detail and explore their implications in real-world applications.


### Section: 6.2 LIFO Queueing System:

The LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) queueing system is another fundamental concept in queueing theory, where the last customer to arrive is the first to be served. This system is also known as the last-come-first-served (LCFS) system. In this section, we will define and analyze the LIFO queueing system, discussing its assumptions, characteristics, and performance.

#### 6.2a Definition and Analysis of LIFO Queueing System

The LIFO queueing system is a single-server queueing system, where customers arrive at a single queue and are served in the reverse order of their arrival. This system is commonly used in real-world scenarios, such as LIFO lanes in warehouses and LIFO stacks in computer memory management. Similar to the FIFO system, the LIFO system also follows the principle of fairness, where customers are served in the order they arrived, ensuring that no customer is unfairly prioritized over others.

To analyze the performance of the LIFO queueing system, we will use the same notation introduced in Chapter 2. Let $N(t)$ be the number of customers in the system at time $t$, $A(t)$ be the number of arrivals up to time $t$, and $D(t)$ be the number of departures up to time $t$. The arrival rate is denoted by $\lambda$ and the service rate by $\mu$. We assume that the arrival process is Poisson with rate $\lambda$ and the service time follows an exponential distribution with mean $1/\mu$.

One key difference between the LIFO and FIFO systems is that the LIFO system allows for overtaking. This means that the order in which customers are served may not necessarily be the same as the order in which they arrived. This can be seen by considering the virtual time concept introduced in the related context. In the LIFO system, the virtual time is not equivalent to the real time, as the finish time for previously queued customers may need to be recomputed due to new arrivals. This adds complexity to the analysis of the system, as we need to consider the order in which customers are served.

Using Little's Law, we can derive the average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$. However, unlike the FIFO system, the LIFO system does not have a simple closed-form solution for $L$. Instead, we must use more advanced techniques, such as Markov chains, to analyze the system. This is due to the fact that the LIFO system is not memoryless, meaning that the future behavior of the system depends on its current state.

In conclusion, the LIFO queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that has applications in various real-world scenarios. While it shares some similarities with the FIFO system, it also has distinct characteristics and requires more advanced analysis techniques. Understanding the LIFO system is crucial for gaining a comprehensive understanding of queueing theory and its applications.


### Section: 6.2 LIFO Queueing System:

The LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) queueing system is another fundamental concept in queueing theory, where the last customer to arrive is the first to be served. This system is also known as the last-come-first-served (LCFS) system. In this section, we will define and analyze the LIFO queueing system, discussing its assumptions, characteristics, and performance.

#### 6.2a Definition and Analysis of LIFO Queueing System

The arrival rate is denoted by $\lambda$ and the service rate by $\mu$. We assume that the arrival process is Poisson with rate $\lambda$ and the service time follows an exponential distribution with mean $1/\mu$.

One key difference between the LIFO and FIFO systems is that the LIFO system allows for overtaking. This means that the order in which customers are served may not necessarily be the same as the order in which they arrived. This can be seen by considering the virtual time concept introduced in the related context. In the LIFO system, the virtual time is not equivalent to the real time, as the finish time for previously queued customers may need to be recomputed due to new arrivals. This adds complexity to the analysis of the system, as we need to consider the impact of overtaking on the performance measures.

#### 6.2b Performance Measures in LIFO Queueing System

In this subsection, we will discuss the performance measures used to evaluate the LIFO queueing system. These measures are similar to those used in the FIFO system, but with some modifications to account for the impact of overtaking.

##### 6.2b.1 Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$, is a measure of the system's congestion. It represents the average number of customers waiting in the queue and being served by the server. In the LIFO system, the average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that $L = \lambda W$, where $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system. However, in the LIFO system, the average waiting time $W$ is not equivalent to the average service time $1/\mu$, as customers may overtake each other. Therefore, the average waiting time needs to be calculated using the virtual time concept, taking into account the impact of overtaking.

##### 6.2b.2 Average Waiting Time in the Queue

The average waiting time in the queue, denoted by $W_q$, is a measure of the time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. In the LIFO system, the average waiting time in the queue can be calculated using the same formula as in the FIFO system, $W_q = L - \lambda/\mu$. However, as mentioned before, the average waiting time needs to be calculated using the virtual time concept, taking into account the impact of overtaking.

##### 6.2b.3 Average Waiting Time in the System

The average waiting time in the system, denoted by $W$, is a measure of the total time a customer spends in the system, including both waiting in the queue and being served by the server. In the LIFO system, the average waiting time in the system can be calculated using the same formula as in the FIFO system, $W = W_q + 1/\mu$. However, as mentioned before, the average waiting time needs to be calculated using the virtual time concept, taking into account the impact of overtaking.

##### 6.2b.4 Probability of Waiting in the Queue

The probability of waiting in the queue, denoted by $P_q$, is a measure of the likelihood that a customer will have to wait in the queue before being served. In the LIFO system, the probability of waiting in the queue can be calculated using the same formula as in the FIFO system, $P_q = \lambda/\mu$. However, as mentioned before, the average waiting time needs to be calculated using the virtual time concept, taking into account the impact of overtaking.

##### 6.2b.5 Probability of Delay

The probability of delay, denoted by $P_d$, is a measure of the likelihood that a customer will experience a delay in the system, i.e. the time spent waiting in the queue and being served by the server. In the LIFO system, the probability of delay can be calculated using the same formula as in the FIFO system, $P_d = \lambda/\mu$. However, as mentioned before, the average waiting time needs to be calculated using the virtual time concept, taking into account the impact of overtaking.

##### 6.2b.6 Probability of Overtaking

The probability of overtaking, denoted by $P_o$, is a measure of the likelihood that a customer will overtake another customer in the system. In the LIFO system, the probability of overtaking can be calculated using the same formula as in the FIFO system, $P_o = \lambda/\mu$. However, as mentioned before, the average waiting time needs to be calculated using the virtual time concept, taking into account the impact of overtaking.

##### 6.2b.7 Throughput

The throughput, denoted by $X$, is a measure of the system's efficiency, representing the average number of customers served per unit time. In the LIFO system, the throughput can be calculated using the same formula as in the FIFO system, $X = \lambda(1 - P_q)$. However, as mentioned before, the average waiting time needs to be calculated using the virtual time concept, taking into account the impact of overtaking.

##### 6.2b.8 Utilization

The utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is a measure of the server's utilization, representing the proportion of time the server is busy serving customers. In the LIFO system, the utilization can be calculated using the same formula as in the FIFO system, $\rho = \lambda/\mu$. However, as mentioned before, the average waiting time needs to be calculated using the virtual time concept, taking into account the impact of overtaking.

In conclusion, the LIFO queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, with real-world applications in various industries. Its performance measures are similar to those of the FIFO system, but with modifications to account for the impact of overtaking. By understanding the characteristics and performance of the LIFO system, we can better analyze and optimize its use in various scenarios.


### Section: 6.3 Priority Queueing System:

The priority queueing system is a variation of the basic queueing system, where customers are served based on their priority rather than their arrival time. This system is commonly used in situations where certain customers require immediate attention or have a higher importance than others. In this section, we will define and analyze the priority queueing system, discussing its assumptions, characteristics, and performance.

#### 6.3a Definition and Analysis of Priority Queueing System

The priority queueing system is a single-server queueing system, where customers arrive at a single queue and are served based on their priority level. The priority level can be assigned based on various factors, such as urgency, importance, or customer type. Customers with higher priority levels are served before those with lower priority levels. This system is commonly used in emergency services, healthcare, and customer service industries.

To analyze the performance of the priority queueing system, we will use the same notation introduced in Chapter 2. Let $N(t)$ be the number of customers in the system at time $t$, $A(t)$ be the number of arrivals up to time $t$, and $D(t)$ be the number of departures up to time $t$. The arrival rate is denoted by $\lambda$ and the service rate by $\mu$. We assume that the arrival process is Poisson with rate $\lambda$ and the service time follows an exponential distribution with mean $1/\mu$.

One key difference between the priority and basic queueing systems is the concept of overtaking. In the priority system, overtaking is not allowed, meaning that customers with lower priority levels cannot overtake those with higher priority levels. This ensures that customers with higher priority levels are always served first, maintaining the fairness principle. However, this also means that customers with lower priority levels may experience longer waiting times, leading to potential dissatisfaction.

To analyze the performance of the priority queueing system, we can use the same approach as in Chapter 2. We can derive the steady-state equations for the system and solve for the expected number of customers in the system, the expected waiting time, and the expected waiting time for customers with different priority levels. We can also calculate the system's utilization and the probability of a customer being served immediately upon arrival. These performance measures can provide insights into the system's efficiency and help in making decisions to improve its performance.

In conclusion, the priority queueing system is a useful variation of the basic queueing system, allowing for the prioritization of customers based on their importance. However, it also introduces the concept of overtaking, which can affect the system's fairness and performance. By analyzing its performance measures, we can gain a better understanding of the system and make informed decisions to optimize its performance.

This ensures that customers with higher priority levels are always served first, maintaining the fairness principle. However, this also means that customers with lower priority levels may experience longer waiting times, leading to potential dissatisfaction.

To analyze the performance of the priority queueing system, we will focus on two main performance measures: the average waiting time and the average queue length. These measures are important in understanding the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

##### 6.3b Performance Measures in Priority Queueing System

The average waiting time in the priority queueing system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate. In the priority system, the arrival rate for each priority level may be different, so the average waiting time for each priority level may also differ. This means that customers with higher priority levels may have a shorter average waiting time compared to those with lower priority levels.

The average queue length in the priority queueing system can be calculated using the Erlang-C formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers. However, in the priority system, the service rate may also vary for each priority level. This means that the average queue length for each priority level may also differ. Customers with higher priority levels may have a shorter average queue length compared to those with lower priority levels.

In addition to these performance measures, it is also important to consider the fairness of the system. While the priority system ensures that customers with higher priority levels are served first, it may also lead to longer waiting times for those with lower priority levels. This can potentially lead to dissatisfaction and may need to be addressed through other means, such as increasing the number of servers or implementing a multi-server priority system.

In conclusion, the priority queueing system is a useful tool in situations where certain customers require immediate attention or have a higher importance than others. By understanding its assumptions, characteristics, and performance measures, we can effectively analyze and optimize the system to meet the needs of different priority levels.

### Section: 6.4 Round Robin Queueing System:

### Subsection (optional): 6.4a Definition and Analysis of Round Robin Queueing System

The round robin queueing system is a type of scheduling algorithm commonly used in computer networks and operating systems. It is a variation of the basic queueing system, where customers are served in a cyclic manner, with each customer receiving a fixed amount of service time before moving to the back of the queue. In this section, we will define and analyze the round robin queueing system, discussing its assumptions, characteristics, and performance.

#### 6.4a Definition and Analysis of Round Robin Queueing System

The round robin queueing system is a single-server queueing system, where customers arrive at a single queue and are served in a cyclic manner. The service time for each customer is fixed and determined by the scheduling algorithm. This system is commonly used in situations where all customers have equal priority and should be served fairly.

To analyze the performance of the round robin queueing system, we will use the same notation introduced in Chapter 2. Let $N(t)$ be the number of customers in the system at time $t$, $A(t)$ be the number of arrivals up to time $t$, and $D(t)$ be the number of departures up to time $t$. The arrival rate is denoted by $\lambda$ and the service rate by $\mu$. We assume that the arrival process is Poisson with rate $\lambda$ and the service time follows an exponential distribution with mean $1/\mu$.

One key characteristic of the round robin queueing system is that it does not allow overtaking. This means that customers cannot overtake each other in the queue, and they are served in the order of their arrival. This ensures fairness in the system, as all customers are served in a cyclic manner without any bias towards certain customers.

To analyze the performance of the round robin queueing system, we can use the concept of weighted round robin. This algorithm assigns weights to each queue, and in each cycle, the scheduler selects the queue with the highest weight and serves the customers in that queue. This ensures that all queues are served equally, and no queue is neglected.

Another approach to analyzing the round robin queueing system is through task scheduling. In this case, the customers can be seen as tasks or processes, and the scheduler assigns a fixed amount of time for each task to be processed. This ensures that all tasks are given equal processing time, and no task is left behind.

In conclusion, the round robin queueing system is a fair and efficient scheduling algorithm that is commonly used in computer networks and operating systems. Its cyclic nature and the absence of overtaking ensure that all customers are served equally, making it a popular choice in various industries.

## Chapter 6: Systems with No Overtaking: Exact Solutions:

### Section: 6.4 Round Robin Queueing System:

### Subsection (optional): 6.4b Performance Measures in Round Robin Queueing System

In the previous subsection, we defined and analyzed the round robin queueing system, discussing its assumptions, characteristics, and performance. In this subsection, we will further explore the performance of this system by discussing its performance measures.

#### 6.4b Performance Measures in Round Robin Queueing System

The performance of a queueing system can be measured by various metrics, such as the average waiting time, the average queue length, and the average number of customers in the system. In the case of the round robin queueing system, these metrics can be calculated using the following equations:

- Average waiting time: $W = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}$
- Average queue length: $L_q = \frac{\lambda}{\mu(\mu - \lambda)}$
- Average number of customers in the system: $L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}$

These equations are derived from the Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a stable queueing system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average waiting time. In the case of the round robin queueing system, the arrival rate is equal to the service rate, as all customers are served in a cyclic manner.

Another important performance measure for the round robin queueing system is the fairness index. This index measures the fairness of the system in terms of the waiting time for each customer. It is calculated using the following equation:

- Fairness index: $F = \frac{W_{max} - W_{min}}{W_{max}}$

Where $W_{max}$ is the maximum waiting time for any customer and $W_{min}$ is the minimum waiting time for any customer. A fairness index of 0 indicates perfect fairness, where all customers have the same waiting time, while a fairness index of 1 indicates complete unfairness, where one customer has a significantly longer waiting time than others.

In addition to these performance measures, the round robin queueing system also has a complexity of $O(log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of queues or flows. This means that as the number of queues or flows increases, the computational load of the system also increases, making it less efficient for larger systems.

Overall, the round robin queueing system is a fair and efficient scheduling algorithm, but it may not be suitable for larger systems due to its increasing complexity. In the next section, we will explore another type of queueing system that addresses this issue - the weighted fair queuing system.


### Conclusion

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored various aspects of queueing theory, from its fundamental concepts to its practical applications. We have discussed different types of queues, their characteristics, and how to analyze and model them. However, in real-world scenarios, there are often systems where overtaking is not allowed. This means that once a customer enters the queue, they cannot overtake other customers and move ahead in the queue. This restriction can significantly impact the behavior and performance of the queueing system.

In this chapter, we will delve into the analysis of systems with no overtaking, also known as non-preemptive systems. We will explore the asymptotic solutions for such systems, which provide a simplified and efficient way to analyze their behavior. These solutions are based on the assumption that the system has reached a steady-state, where the arrival and service rates are constant over time. We will also discuss the limitations of these solutions and when they can be applied.

The chapter will be divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of systems with no overtaking. We will begin by introducing the concept of non-preemptive systems and discussing their characteristics. Then, we will explore the asymptotic solutions for single-server and multi-server systems, along with their derivations. We will also discuss the impact of different queue disciplines, such as first-come-first-served and last-come-first-served, on the performance of non-preemptive systems.

Furthermore, we will extend our analysis to systems with multiple classes of customers, where each class has different arrival and service rates. We will explore how the asymptotic solutions can be applied to such systems and how they can be used to optimize the performance of the system. Finally, we will discuss the limitations of asymptotic solutions and when they may not be applicable. Overall, this chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of systems with no overtaking and their asymptotic solutions, which are essential for analyzing and optimizing real-world queueing systems.

### Section: 7.1 Long-Run Average Queue Length:

In this section, we will explore the concept of long-run average queue length in systems with no overtaking. This is an important performance measure that provides insight into the behavior of the queueing system over time. We will define the long-run average queue length and analyze its properties, along with its impact on the overall performance of the system.

#### 7.1a Definition and Analysis of Long-Run Average Queue Length

The long-run average queue length, denoted by $L$, is defined as the average number of customers in the queue over an infinite time horizon. It is a measure of the steady-state behavior of the queueing system and is often used to evaluate the performance of the system. In systems with no overtaking, the long-run average queue length is affected by the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline.

To analyze the long-run average queue length, we will use the asymptotic solutions for non-preemptive systems. These solutions are based on the assumption that the system has reached a steady-state, where the arrival and service rates are constant over time. In such systems, the long-run average queue length can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the long-run average queue length is equal to the product of the long-run average arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, and the long-run average waiting time, denoted by $W$.

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

The long-run average arrival rate, $\lambda$, is the average number of customers arriving at the system per unit time, while the long-run average waiting time, $W$, is the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. These two parameters are affected by the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline, and can be calculated using the asymptotic solutions.

In systems with no overtaking, the long-run average queue length is also affected by the queue discipline. For example, in a first-come-first-served (FCFS) system, the first customer to arrive is the first to be served, while in a last-come-first-served (LCFS) system, the last customer to arrive is the first to be served. This difference in queue discipline can significantly impact the long-run average queue length, as well as other performance measures such as waiting time and queue size distribution.

Furthermore, the long-run average queue length can also be affected by the arrival and service rates. In systems with heavy-tailed traffic, where the arrival rate is higher than the service rate, the long-run average queue length can increase significantly. This is because heavy-tailed traffic is characterized by large bursts of arrivals, which can lead to longer waiting times and larger queue sizes. This can have a negative impact on the overall performance of the system, as seen in the graph above.

In conclusion, the long-run average queue length is an important performance measure in systems with no overtaking. It is affected by various factors such as arrival and service rates, queue discipline, and traffic characteristics. By analyzing the long-run average queue length, we can gain insight into the behavior of the queueing system and make informed decisions to optimize its performance.

### Section: 7.1 Long-Run Average Queue Length:

In this section, we will explore the concept of long-run average queue length in systems with no overtaking. This is an important performance measure that provides insight into the behavior of the queueing system over time. We will define the long-run average queue length and analyze its properties, along with its impact on the overall performance of the system.

#### 7.1a Definition and Analysis of Long-Run Average Queue Length

The long-run average queue length, denoted by $L$, is defined as the average number of customers in the queue over an infinite time horizon. It is a measure of the steady-state behavior of the queueing system and is often used to evaluate the performance of the system. In systems with no overtaking, the long-run average queue length is affected by the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline.

To analyze the long-run average queue length, we will use the asymptotic solutions for non-preemptive systems. These solutions are based on the assumption that the system has reached a steady-state, where the arrival and service rates are constant over time. In such systems, the long-run average queue length can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the long-run average queue length is equal to the product of the long-run average arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, and the long-run average waiting time, denoted by $W$.

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

The long-run average arrival rate, $\lambda$, is the average number of customers arriving at the system per unit time, while the long-run average waiting time, $W$, is the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. These two parameters are affected by the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline, and can be calculated using the asymptotic solutions.

In systems with no overtaking, the long-run average queue length can be estimated using Buzen's algorithm. This algorithm provides an efficient procedure for computing the normalizing constant, $G(N)$, which is necessary for calculating the steady-state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility. By solving the equation $\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}$ for each service facility, we can determine the values of $X_i$ and use them to calculate the long-run average arrival rate, $\lambda$, and the long-run average waiting time, $W$.

Another important concept in the analysis of long-run average queue length is the Fork-Join queue. This model consists of multiple service facilities joined in series, where a job must pass through each facility before being completed. In this case, an approximate formula can be used to calculate the response time distribution, which is related to the long-run average waiting time, $W$. Additionally, the Split-Merge model, where a job is split into multiple sub-tasks that are serviced in parallel, can also be used to analyze the long-run average queue length. Exact results for this model are given by Fiorini and Lipsky.

In conclusion, the long-run average queue length is an important performance measure in systems with no overtaking. It is affected by various factors such as arrival and service rates, queue discipline, and system structure. By using asymptotic solutions and algorithms such as Buzen's algorithm, we can estimate the long-run average queue length and gain insight into the behavior of the queueing system over time.

### Section: 7.2 Long-Run Average Waiting Time:

In this section, we will explore the concept of long-run average waiting time in systems with no overtaking. This is an important performance measure that provides insight into the behavior of the queueing system over time. We will define the long-run average waiting time and analyze its properties, along with its impact on the overall performance of the system.

#### 7.2a Definition and Analysis of Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time, denoted by $W$, is defined as the average amount of time a job spends in the system from the instant of arrival to the time they leave the system. It is a measure of the steady-state behavior of the queueing system and is often used to evaluate the performance of the system. In systems with no overtaking, the long-run average waiting time is affected by the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline.

To analyze the long-run average waiting time, we will use the asymptotic solutions for non-preemptive systems. These solutions are based on the assumption that the system has reached a steady-state, where the arrival and service rates are constant over time. In such systems, the long-run average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the long-run average waiting time is equal to the ratio of the long-run average queue length, denoted by $L$, and the long-run average arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$.

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

The long-run average queue length, $L$, is the average number of customers in the queue over an infinite time horizon, while the long-run average arrival rate, $\lambda$, is the average number of customers arriving at the system per unit time. These two parameters are affected by the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline, and can be calculated using the asymptotic solutions.

In systems with no overtaking, the long-run average waiting time can also be calculated using the Pollaczek–Khinchine transform, which is given by the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the waiting time distribution, denoted by $W^*(s)$, and the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the service time probability density function, denoted by $g(s)$.

$$
W = W^*(s) + \frac{1}{g(s)}
$$

This formula allows for a more detailed analysis of the long-run average waiting time, taking into account the distribution of service times. Additionally, the arrival theorem holds in systems with no overtaking, as the arrivals are determined by a Poisson process.

In the case of multiple servers, the long-run average waiting time remains an open problem, with only approximations and bounds known. However, for systems with two servers and exponentially distributed service times, the exact formula for the average waiting time is known. In this situation, the waiting time is given by the sum of the waiting times in each server, which can be calculated using the M/M/1 queue formula.

$$
W = \frac{1}{\mu_1 - \lambda} + \frac{1}{\mu_2 - \lambda}
$$

Where $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the service rates of the two servers. For systems with more than two servers, Varki's modification of mean value analysis can be used to give an approximate value for the average waiting time.

In conclusion, the long-run average waiting time is an important performance measure in systems with no overtaking, providing insight into the steady-state behavior of the queueing system. It can be calculated using Little's Law or the Pollaczek–Khinchine transform, and its value is affected by the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline. Further research is needed to determine the exact formula for systems with multiple servers, but approximations and bounds are available. 


### Section: 7.2 Long-Run Average Waiting Time:

In this section, we will explore the concept of long-run average waiting time in systems with no overtaking. This is an important performance measure that provides insight into the behavior of the queueing system over time. We will define the long-run average waiting time and analyze its properties, along with its impact on the overall performance of the system.

#### 7.2b Estimating Long-Run Average Waiting Time in Queueing Systems

In order to estimate the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems, we must first understand the factors that affect it. As mentioned in the previous section, the long-run average waiting time is influenced by the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline. Let's take a closer look at each of these factors.

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is the average number of customers arriving at the system per unit time. In a queueing system, the arrival rate is often modeled as a Poisson process, where the inter-arrival times between customers follow an exponential distribution. This means that the arrival rate is constant over time and is not affected by the number of customers already in the system.

The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the average number of customers that can be served by the system per unit time. In a queueing system, the service rate is often modeled as a general distribution, denoted by $g(s)$, where $s$ represents the service time. This means that the service rate can vary depending on the service time of each customer.

The queue discipline refers to the rules that determine which customer is served next when there are multiple customers waiting in the queue. In systems with no overtaking, the queue discipline is often non-preemptive, meaning that once a customer begins service, they cannot be interrupted or preempted by another customer. This can have a significant impact on the long-run average waiting time, as customers with longer service times may cause longer waiting times for other customers.

Now that we have a better understanding of the factors that affect the long-run average waiting time, we can use the asymptotic solutions for non-preemptive systems to estimate it. As mentioned in the previous section, Little's Law states that the long-run average waiting time is equal to the ratio of the long-run average queue length, denoted by $L$, and the long-run average arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$.

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

To calculate the long-run average queue length, we can use the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which is based on the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the waiting time distribution. This formula takes into account the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline, and provides an accurate estimate of the long-run average queue length.

Once we have calculated the long-run average queue length, we can use Little's Law to estimate the long-run average waiting time. However, it is important to note that these estimates are based on the assumption that the system has reached a steady-state, where the arrival and service rates are constant over time. In real-world scenarios, this may not always be the case, and the actual long-run average waiting time may differ from our estimates.

In conclusion, estimating the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems requires an understanding of the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline. By using the asymptotic solutions and Little's Law, we can obtain accurate estimates of the long-run average waiting time, which can provide valuable insights into the performance of the system. However, it is important to keep in mind that these estimates are based on certain assumptions and may not always reflect the actual waiting time in real-world scenarios.


### Section: 7.3 Asymptotic Behavior of Queueing Systems:

In this section, we will explore the asymptotic behavior of queueing systems with no overtaking. Asymptotic solutions provide a way to analyze the long-term behavior of a system, which can be useful in understanding its performance and making predictions. We will define and analyze the asymptotic behavior of queueing systems, and discuss its applications in various scenarios.

#### 7.3a Definition and Analysis of Asymptotic Behavior in Queueing Systems

Asymptotic behavior refers to the long-term behavior of a system as time approaches infinity. In queueing systems, this can be seen as the behavior of the system when it reaches a steady state, where the arrival and service rates are balanced and the system is in equilibrium. This is an important concept to understand, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system over time.

To analyze the asymptotic behavior of a queueing system, we must first understand the factors that affect it. As mentioned in the previous section, the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline, play a crucial role in determining the long-run average waiting time. In addition to these factors, the number of service facilities and circulating customers also impact the asymptotic behavior of a queueing system.

The number of service facilities, denoted by "M", refers to the number of servers available to serve customers in the system. In a queueing system, the number of service facilities can greatly affect the system's performance. For example, a system with a large number of service facilities may have a lower long-run average waiting time compared to a system with a smaller number of service facilities.

The number of circulating customers, denoted by "N", refers to the number of customers in the system at any given time. This factor is closely related to the arrival and service rates, as it determines the level of congestion in the system. A higher number of circulating customers can lead to longer waiting times and slower service times, ultimately affecting the asymptotic behavior of the system.

In order to analyze the asymptotic behavior of a queueing system, we can use Buzen's algorithm. This algorithm provides an efficient way to compute the normalizing constant, "G(N)", which is necessary for calculating the steady state probabilities of the system. By solving the equations for "X_i" using Buzen's algorithm, we can determine the values of "X_i" and ultimately analyze the asymptotic behavior of the system.

In conclusion, understanding the asymptotic behavior of queueing systems is crucial in analyzing their performance and making predictions about their behavior over time. By considering factors such as the arrival and service rates, queue discipline, number of service facilities, and circulating customers, we can gain valuable insights into the long-term behavior of a queueing system.

Asymptotic solutions provide a way to analyze the long-term behavior of a system, which can be useful in understanding its performance and making predictions. We will define and analyze the asymptotic behavior of queueing systems, and discuss its applications in various scenarios.

#### 7.3b Understanding the Limiting Behavior of Queueing Systems

Asymptotic behavior refers to the long-term behavior of a system as time approaches infinity. In queueing systems, this can be seen as the behavior of the system when it reaches a steady state, where the arrival and service rates are balanced and the system is in equilibrium. This is an important concept to understand, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system over time.

To analyze the asymptotic behavior of a queueing system, we must first understand the factors that affect it. As mentioned in the previous section, the arrival and service rates, as well as the queue discipline, play a crucial role in determining the long-run average waiting time. In addition to these factors, the number of service facilities and circulating customers also impact the asymptotic behavior of a queueing system.

The number of service facilities, denoted by "M", refers to the number of servers available to serve customers in the system. In a queueing system, the number of service facilities can greatly affect the system's performance. For example, a system with a large number of service facilities may have a lower long-run average waiting time compared to a system with a smaller number of service facilities.

The number of circulating customers, denoted by "N", refers to the number of customers in the system at any given time. This factor is closely related to the arrival and service rates, as it determines the level of congestion in the system. A higher number of circulating customers can lead to longer waiting times and a decrease in the system's overall performance.

In order to understand the limiting behavior of queueing systems, we must first define the concept of a limiting distribution. A limiting distribution is the steady state probability distribution that a system approaches as time goes to infinity. In other words, it is the long-term behavior of the system. In queueing systems, the limiting distribution is affected by the arrival and service rates, as well as the number of service facilities and circulating customers.

One way to analyze the limiting behavior of queueing systems is through the use of Buzen's algorithm. This algorithm provides an efficient way to compute the normalizing constant, "G(N)", which is necessary for calculating the steady state probabilities of the system. By solving the equations for "X_i", we can determine the values of "X_i" and use them to calculate the steady state probabilities. This allows us to understand the limiting behavior of the system and make predictions about its performance.

Another important concept in understanding the limiting behavior of queueing systems is the Fork-Join queue. This type of queueing system consists of multiple service facilities joined in series, where a job must go through each facility in order before being completed. By using an approximate formula, we can calculate the response time distribution for a network of Fork-Join queues. This can be useful in predicting the performance of complex queueing systems.

In addition to the Fork-Join queue, the Split-Merge model is another useful tool for understanding the limiting behavior of queueing systems. In this model, a job is split into "N" sub-tasks which are serviced in parallel. Only when all the tasks have finished servicing and have rejoined can the next job start. This leads to a slower response time, but analytical results exist for this model, making it a valuable tool for analyzing queueing systems.

In conclusion, understanding the limiting behavior of queueing systems is crucial in predicting their performance and making informed decisions about system design and management. By considering factors such as arrival and service rates, queue discipline, number of service facilities, and circulating customers, we can use tools like Buzen's algorithm, Fork-Join queues, and the Split-Merge model to analyze and make predictions about the long-term behavior of queueing systems. 


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored systems with no overtaking and their asymptotic solutions in queueing theory.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction:

In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of priority and polling systems in queueing theory. This is an important aspect of queueing theory as it allows for the optimization of system performance by giving certain tasks or customers priority over others. We will explore the fundamentals of priority and polling systems, including their definitions, characteristics, and mathematical models. We will also discuss the various types of priority and polling systems, such as preemptive and non-preemptive systems, and their applications in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we will cover advanced topics such as priority queues and polling networks, and how they can be used to improve system efficiency and reduce waiting times. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of priority and polling systems and their role in queueing theory. 


## Chapter 8: Priority, Polling Systems:

### Section: 8.1 Priority Queues:

Priority queues are an important concept in computer science and queueing theory. They are an abstract data type that allows for the ordering of elements based on their priority. In this section, we will define and analyze priority queues, discussing their characteristics, operations, and mathematical models.

#### 8.1a Definition and Analysis of Priority Queues

A priority queue is a data structure where each element has an associated priority. Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority. In some implementations, if two elements have the same priority, they are served in the same order in which they were enqueued. This allows for the optimization of system performance by giving certain tasks or customers priority over others.

In computer science, priority queues are often implemented using heaps, but they are conceptually distinct from heaps. While heaps are a specific data structure, priority queues are an abstract data type that can be implemented using various methods, such as heaps or unordered arrays.

In terms of operations, a priority queue must at least support the following:

- Enqueue: adds an element to the queue with its associated priority
- Dequeue: removes and returns the element with the highest priority
- Peek: returns the element with the highest priority without removing it from the queue

The "peek" operation is crucial in many applications of priority queues and is often implemented to execute in O(1) time. More advanced implementations may support additional operations, such as inspecting the first few highest- or lowest-priority elements, clearing the queue, or merging two or more queues into one.

In queueing theory, priority queues are used to model systems where certain tasks or customers have priority over others. This can be seen in real-world scenarios such as emergency rooms, where patients with more severe conditions are given priority over those with less severe conditions.

Mathematically, priority queues can be represented using the notation M/G/1, where M represents the Markovian arrival process, G represents the general service time distribution, and 1 represents a single server. The analysis of priority queues involves calculating the average waiting time, queue length, and other performance metrics. This can be done using various techniques, such as the M/M/1 queueing model or the Erlang-C formula.

In conclusion, priority queues are an important concept in queueing theory, allowing for the optimization of system performance by giving certain tasks or customers priority over others. They are an abstract data type that can be implemented using various methods and have applications in real-world scenarios. The analysis of priority queues involves calculating performance metrics using mathematical models. In the next subsection, we will explore the different types of priority queues and their applications.


### Section: 8.1 Priority Queues:

Priority queues are an essential tool in both computer science and queueing theory. They allow for the efficient ordering of elements based on their priority, making them useful in a variety of applications. In this section, we will define and analyze priority queues, discussing their characteristics, operations, and mathematical models.

#### 8.1a Definition and Analysis of Priority Queues

A priority queue is a data structure where each element has an associated priority. Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority. In some implementations, if two elements have the same priority, they are served in the same order in which they were enqueued. This allows for the optimization of system performance by giving certain tasks or customers priority over others.

The "peek" operation is crucial in many applications of priority queues and is often implemented to execute in O(1) time. More advanced implementations may support additional operations, such as inspecting the first few highest- or lowest-priority elements, clearing the queue, or merging two or more queues into one.

#### 8.1b Performance Evaluation of Priority Queues

In order to evaluate the performance of priority queues, we must first define the metrics by which we will measure their efficiency. The most common metrics used are the time complexity of operations and the space complexity of the data structure.

The time complexity of operations refers to the amount of time it takes for an operation to be completed, as a function of the size of the data structure. In the case of priority queues, we are primarily concerned with the time complexity of enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations. These operations should ideally have a time complexity of O(1) in order to ensure efficient performance.

The space complexity of a data structure refers to the amount of memory it requires to store its elements. In the case of priority queues, the space complexity is typically O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue. This is because priority queues often use arrays or linked lists to store their elements, which require a fixed amount of memory for each element.

In terms of mathematical models, priority queues can be analyzed using queueing theory. This branch of mathematics deals with the study of waiting lines and the behavior of systems where customers or tasks arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. Priority queues can be modeled as a special type of queueing system, where the priority of each element determines its position in the queue.

In conclusion, priority queues are a fundamental concept in computer science and queueing theory. They allow for the efficient ordering of elements based on their priority, making them useful in a variety of applications. By understanding their definition, operations, and performance metrics, we can effectively utilize priority queues in both theoretical and practical settings.


### Section: 8.2 Preemptive Scheduling:

Preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling used in queueing systems where the scheduler can interrupt a running task and switch to a higher priority task. This allows for the efficient utilization of resources and ensures that high priority tasks are completed in a timely manner. In this section, we will define and analyze preemptive scheduling in queueing systems, discussing its characteristics, advantages, and mathematical models.

#### 8.2a Definition and Analysis of Preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

Preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling where the scheduler can interrupt a running task and switch to a higher priority task. This is in contrast to non-preemptive scheduling, where a task must finish its execution before another task can be scheduled. In preemptive scheduling, the scheduler is constantly monitoring the ready queue and can make decisions to switch tasks based on their priority.

In queueing systems, preemptive scheduling is often used to prioritize certain types of jobs or customers over others. For example, in a computer system, a high priority task may be given more CPU time than a low priority task, ensuring that critical tasks are completed in a timely manner. In a customer service setting, customers with urgent needs may be given priority over those with less urgent needs.

The main advantage of preemptive scheduling is its ability to efficiently utilize resources. By constantly monitoring the ready queue and switching to higher priority tasks, the scheduler can ensure that important tasks are completed in a timely manner. This can lead to improved system performance and customer satisfaction.

In terms of mathematical models, preemptive scheduling can be analyzed using techniques from stochastic scheduling. This involves using mathematical models, such as multiclass queueing networks, to study the performance of preemptive scheduling in different scenarios. These models can help determine the optimal service disciplines for preemptive scheduling in various queueing systems.

#### 8.2b Implementation of Preemptive Scheduling in Nano-RK

Nano-RK, a real-time operating system, implements preemptive scheduling using a priority-based scheduler. This scheduler constantly monitors the ready queue, which is a double-linked list of ready queue nodes within a fixed-size array. The tasks in the ready queue are ordered in decreasing order by their priority, with the highest priority task at the head of the queue.

The scheduler in Nano-RK always selects the highest priority task from the ready queue to run. This ensures that important tasks are given priority over less important tasks. Additionally, Nano-RK also incorporates energy efficiency into its preemptive scheduling. Tasks do not poll for resources, but rather are blocked on certain events and can be unlocked when those events occur. This helps save energy by allowing the system to be powered down when there are no tasks in the ready queue.

In conclusion, preemptive scheduling is a powerful tool in queueing theory that allows for the efficient utilization of resources and prioritization of tasks. Its implementation in Nano-RK showcases its effectiveness in real-world systems. By understanding the definition and analysis of preemptive scheduling, we can better design and optimize queueing systems for various applications.


### Section: 8.2 Preemptive Scheduling:

Preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling used in queueing systems where the scheduler can interrupt a running task and switch to a higher priority task. This allows for the efficient utilization of resources and ensures that high priority tasks are completed in a timely manner. In this section, we will define and analyze preemptive scheduling in queueing systems, discussing its characteristics, advantages, and mathematical models.

#### 8.2a Definition and Analysis of Preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

Preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling where the scheduler can interrupt a running task and switch to a higher priority task. This is in contrast to non-preemptive scheduling, where a task must finish its execution before another task can be scheduled. In preemptive scheduling, the scheduler is constantly monitoring the ready queue and can make decisions to switch tasks based on their priority.

In queueing systems, preemptive scheduling is often used to prioritize certain types of jobs or customers over others. For example, in a computer system, a high priority task may be given more CPU time than a low priority task, ensuring that critical tasks are completed in a timely manner. In a customer service setting, customers with urgent needs may be given priority over those with less urgent needs.

The main advantage of preemptive scheduling is its ability to efficiently utilize resources. By constantly monitoring the ready queue and switching to higher priority tasks, the scheduler can ensure that important tasks are completed in a timely manner. This can lead to improved system performance and customer satisfaction.

In terms of mathematical models, preemptive scheduling can be analyzed using techniques from stochastic scheduling. This involves using mathematical models, such as multiclass queueing networks, to study the performance of preemptive scheduling in different scenarios. These models can help determine the impact of preemptive scheduling on system performance, such as the average waiting time for tasks and the utilization of resources.

### Subsection: 8.2b Impact of Preemptive Scheduling on System Performance

The use of preemptive scheduling can have a significant impact on the performance of a queueing system. As mentioned earlier, preemptive scheduling allows for the efficient utilization of resources by prioritizing high priority tasks. This can lead to a decrease in the average waiting time for tasks, as important tasks are given priority over less important ones.

Additionally, preemptive scheduling can also improve the overall utilization of resources. By constantly monitoring the ready queue and switching to higher priority tasks, the scheduler can ensure that resources are not left idle. This can lead to a more efficient use of resources and potentially increase the throughput of the system.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to using preemptive scheduling. One major concern is the potential for starvation, where low priority tasks may never get a chance to run if there are constantly high priority tasks in the ready queue. This can lead to a decrease in overall system performance and fairness.

To mitigate the risk of starvation, some queueing systems may implement aging techniques, where the priority of a task increases over time if it has been waiting for a long period. This ensures that all tasks eventually get a chance to run, while still prioritizing high priority tasks.

In conclusion, preemptive scheduling can have a significant impact on the performance of a queueing system. By efficiently utilizing resources and prioritizing high priority tasks, preemptive scheduling can lead to improved system performance and customer satisfaction. However, it is important to carefully consider the potential drawbacks and implement strategies to mitigate them.


### Section: 8.3 Non-preemptive Scheduling:

Non-preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling used in queueing systems where the scheduler cannot interrupt a running task and switch to a higher priority task. In this section, we will define and analyze non-preemptive scheduling in queueing systems, discussing its characteristics, advantages, and mathematical models.

#### 8.3a Definition and Analysis of Non-preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

Non-preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling where the scheduler cannot interrupt a running task and switch to a higher priority task. This means that a task must finish its execution before another task can be scheduled. In non-preemptive scheduling, the scheduler is not constantly monitoring the ready queue and can only make decisions to switch tasks when a task has finished its execution.

In queueing systems, non-preemptive scheduling is often used when all tasks have similar priorities or when the cost of switching tasks is high. For example, in a manufacturing setting, a non-preemptive scheduling approach may be used to ensure that a machine completes its current task before switching to a new one. This can help reduce the cost of frequent task switching and improve overall efficiency.

One of the main advantages of non-preemptive scheduling is its simplicity. Since the scheduler does not need to constantly monitor the ready queue, the scheduling algorithm can be less complex and easier to implement. This can be beneficial in systems where real-time scheduling is not critical.

In terms of mathematical models, non-preemptive scheduling can also be analyzed using techniques from stochastic scheduling. However, the models used may differ from those used for preemptive scheduling. For example, in non-preemptive scheduling, the service time of a task is fixed and does not depend on the priority of the task. This can affect the performance of the system and must be taken into account in the mathematical models.

In conclusion, non-preemptive scheduling is a useful approach in queueing systems where all tasks have similar priorities or when the cost of switching tasks is high. Its simplicity and ease of implementation make it a popular choice in certain applications. However, it is important to carefully consider the characteristics of the system and the impact of non-preemptive scheduling on its performance before implementing it.


### Section: 8.3 Non-preemptive Scheduling:

Non-preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling used in queueing systems where the scheduler cannot interrupt a running task and switch to a higher priority task. In this section, we will define and analyze non-preemptive scheduling in queueing systems, discussing its characteristics, advantages, and mathematical models.

#### 8.3a Definition and Analysis of Non-preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

Non-preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling where the scheduler cannot interrupt a running task and switch to a higher priority task. This means that a task must finish its execution before another task can be scheduled.

This can affect the performance of the system and must be taken into account in the mathematical models.

#### 8.3b Evaluating the Effectiveness of Non-preemptive Scheduling

To evaluate the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling, we can use metrics such as average waiting time, average response time, and throughput. These metrics can help us understand the performance of the system and compare it to other scheduling algorithms.

One important factor to consider when evaluating non-preemptive scheduling is the impact of task priorities on the system's performance. In non-preemptive scheduling, tasks with higher priorities may have to wait longer for their turn to execute, which can increase their waiting and response times. This can be particularly problematic in systems with a mix of high and low priority tasks.

Another factor to consider is the effect of task arrival patterns on the system's performance. In non-preemptive scheduling, tasks are only scheduled when the current task has finished its execution. This means that if a large number of high priority tasks arrive at the same time, they may have to wait for a long time before being scheduled, leading to increased waiting and response times.

To address these issues, some non-preemptive scheduling algorithms use techniques such as aging, where the priority of a task increases the longer it waits in the ready queue. This can help reduce the waiting and response times of high priority tasks and improve the overall performance of the system.

In conclusion, non-preemptive scheduling is a simple and efficient scheduling approach that can be used in queueing systems. However, its effectiveness may be limited in certain scenarios, and careful consideration must be given to task priorities and arrival patterns when designing and evaluating non-preemptive scheduling algorithms. 


### Section: 8.4 Polling Systems:

Polling systems are a type of scheduling system used in queueing theory to manage the access of multiple elements to a shared resource. In this section, we will define and analyze polling systems, discussing their applications, types, and mathematical models.

#### 8.4a Definition and Analysis of Polling Systems

A polling system is a type of scheduling system where a central device or process, known as the polling device, queries each element in a fixed sequence to determine which element needs access to a shared resource. The polling device then grants access to the element with the highest priority, if any, and continues polling the remaining elements until all have been serviced. This process is repeated in a continuous cycle.

Polling systems have been used to model various real-world scenarios, such as Token Ring networks and multi-issue voting systems. In Token Ring networks, polling is used to determine which nodes want to access the network, while in multi-issue voting systems, it is used to allocate resources to competing processes.

There are two main types of polling systems: roll call polling and hub polling. In roll call polling, the polling device queries each element in a fixed sequence and waits for a response before moving on to the next element. This can be inefficient if there are numerous elements to be polled and only a few are active. On the other hand, in hub polling, each element polls the next element in a fixed sequence, creating a continuous loop. This can be more efficient as it eliminates the need for the polling device to wait for a response from each element.

The optimal polling cycle, or the time in which each element is monitored once, will vary depending on factors such as the desired speed of response and the overhead of the polling messages. In some cases, it may be more efficient to use interrupts, which are signals generated by devices or processes to indicate that they need attention, instead of polling.

In terms of mathematical models, polling systems can be analyzed using techniques from stochastic scheduling. However, the models used may differ from those used for other scheduling systems. For example, in polling systems, the service time of an element is fixed and does not depend on its priority. This can affect the performance of the system and must be taken into account in the mathematical models.

In conclusion, polling systems are a useful tool in queueing theory for managing the access of multiple elements to a shared resource. They have various applications and types, and their performance can be analyzed using stochastic scheduling techniques.

In some cases, it may be more efficient to use interrupts, which are signals generated by devices or processes to indicate that they need attention, instead of continuously polling all elements.

#### 8.4b Performance Evaluation of Polling Systems

In order to evaluate the performance of polling systems, we can use mathematical models to analyze their behavior. One commonly used model is the M/G/1 queue, which assumes that arrivals to the queue follow a Poisson process and service times follow a general distribution. This model can be extended to polling systems by considering the polling device as the server and the elements as the customers.

Using this model, we can calculate important performance metrics such as the average waiting time and the average number of elements in the queue. These metrics can help us determine the efficiency of the polling system and identify potential areas for improvement.

Another important aspect to consider in polling systems is the priority scheme used to determine which element is granted access to the shared resource. Different priority schemes can have a significant impact on the performance of the system, and it is important to carefully design and evaluate these schemes to ensure optimal performance.

In addition to mathematical models, simulations can also be used to evaluate the performance of polling systems. By simulating different scenarios and varying parameters such as the number of elements and the polling cycle, we can gain a better understanding of how the system behaves and make informed decisions about its design and implementation.

Overall, the performance evaluation of polling systems is crucial in understanding their behavior and optimizing their performance. By using mathematical models and simulations, we can gain valuable insights into the system and make informed decisions to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the concept of priority and polling systems in queueing theory. We have seen how these systems can be used to manage queues and improve the overall efficiency of a system. We have also discussed the different types of priority systems, such as preemptive and non-preemptive, and how they can be applied in various scenarios. Additionally, we have looked at polling systems and how they can be used to allocate resources among different queues.

Priority and polling systems are essential tools in queueing theory, and understanding their principles and applications can greatly benefit system designers and managers. By implementing these systems, we can ensure that high-priority tasks are given the necessary attention and resources, while also preventing lower-priority tasks from being neglected. This can lead to improved customer satisfaction, reduced waiting times, and increased overall system performance.

In conclusion, priority and polling systems are powerful tools that can be used to optimize queueing systems. By carefully designing and implementing these systems, we can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our systems, leading to better outcomes for both customers and service providers.

### Exercises

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction:

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, including the basic concepts, models, and applications. We have also discussed various types of queues, such as single-server queues, multiple-server queues, and finite-capacity queues. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of queueing theory by exploring multiserver queues.

Multiserver queues are a type of queueing system where there are multiple servers available to serve the arriving customers. This type of queueing system is commonly found in various real-world scenarios, such as call centers, supermarkets, and transportation systems. In these systems, the customers are served by multiple servers simultaneously, which can significantly reduce the waiting time and improve the overall efficiency of the system.

In this chapter, we will cover various topics related to multiserver queues, including the characteristics of multiserver queues, the arrival and service processes, and the performance measures. We will also discuss the different types of multiserver queues, such as parallel queues, series queues, and tandem queues. Furthermore, we will explore advanced applications of multiserver queues, such as load balancing and resource allocation.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of multiserver queues and their applications. You will also be able to analyze and model different types of multiserver queues to optimize their performance. So, let's dive into the world of multiserver queues and discover the fascinating concepts and applications of this important branch of queueing theory. 


## Chapter 9: Multiserver Queues:

### Section: 9.1 M/M/s Queueing System:

In this section, we will focus on the M/M/s queueing system, which is a type of multiserver queueing system. This system is characterized by having `s` identical servers, each with an exponential service time distribution with rate `μ`. The arrival process of customers follows a Poisson process with rate `λ`. The notation M/M/s stands for Markovian arrival process/Markovian service process/`s` servers.

#### Definition and Analysis of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is a popular model for analyzing multiserver queues. It is a special case of the M/G/s queueing system, where the service time distribution follows a general distribution instead of an exponential one. In the M/M/s queueing system, the arrival and service processes are memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of the past events.

To analyze the M/M/s queueing system, we use the concept of traffic intensity, denoted by `ρ`. It is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate `λ` to the service rate `sμ`. If `ρ < 1`, the system is stable, and the queue will not grow without bound. However, if `ρ > 1`, the queue will grow without bound, and the system is considered unstable.

The stationary distribution of the M/M/s queueing system can be calculated using the probability mass function `π`<sub>`k`</sub>, which represents the probability that the system contains `k` customers. It is given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & \text{if } k < s \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^k}{s^{k-s}}, & \text{if } k \geq s
\end{cases}
$$

The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by Erlang's C formula, denoted by C(`s`, `λ`/`μ`). It is defined as:

$$
C(s, \lambda/\mu) = \frac{(s(\lambda/\mu)^s)}{s!} \frac{1}{(1-\rho)} \sum_{k=s}^{\infty} \frac{(s\rho)^{k-s}}{(k-s)!}
$$

The average number of customers in the system (in service and in the queue) is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} C(s, \lambda/\mu) + s\rho
$$

#### Busy Period of Server

The busy period of the M/M/s queue can refer to two things: the time until the first `k` customers are served and the time until the system becomes empty. Let `T`<sub>`k`</sub> be the minimum time until there are `k` jobs in the system at time 0<sup>+</sup> and `k` - 1 jobs in the system at time `t`. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the distribution of `T`<sub>`k`</sub> is denoted by `η`<sub>`k`</sub>(`s`) and is given by:

$$
\eta_k(s) = \frac{1}{s} \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{k-1} (s+i\mu)}{\prod_{i=1}^{k} (s+i\mu-\lambda)}
$$

#### Response Time

The response time in the M/M/s queueing system is the total amount of time a customer spends in both the queue and in service. It is the same for all work conserving service disciplines and is given by:

$$
T_r = \frac{C(s, \lambda/\mu)}{s\mu - \lambda} + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

##### Customers in First-Come, First-Served Discipline

In the first-come, first-served discipline, the customer either experiences an immediate exponential service or must wait for `k` customers to be served before their own service. This results in an Erlang distribution with shape parameter `k` + 1.

##### Customers in Processor Sharing Discipline

In a processor sharing queue, the service capacity of the queue is split equally between the jobs in the queue. In the M/M/s queue, this means that when there are `s` or fewer jobs in the system, each job is serviced at rate `μ`. However, when there are more than `s` jobs in the system, the service rate for each job decreases proportionally. The response time in this discipline is given by the same formula as above.


## Chapter 9: Multiserver Queues:

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals and advanced applications of multiserver queues. These types of queues are characterized by having multiple servers, each with their own service time distribution. We will begin by discussing the M/M/s queueing system, which is a popular model for analyzing multiserver queues.

### Section: 9.1 M/M/s Queueing System:

The M/M/s queueing system is a type of multiserver queueing system that is commonly used in the analysis of communication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. It is a special case of the M/G/s queueing system, where the service time distribution follows a general distribution instead of an exponential one. In the M/M/s queueing system, the arrival and service processes are memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of the past events.

#### Definition and Analysis of M/M/s Queueing System

To analyze the M/M/s queueing system, we use the concept of traffic intensity, denoted by `ρ`. It is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate `λ` to the service rate `sμ`. If `ρ < 1`, the system is stable, and the queue will not grow without bound. However, if `ρ > 1`, the queue will grow without bound, and the system is considered unstable.

The stationary distribution of the M/M/s queueing system can be calculated using the probability mass function `π`<sub>`k`</sub>, which represents the probability that the system contains `k` customers. It is given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & \text{if } k < s \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^k}{s^{k-s}}, & \text{if } k \geq s
\end{cases}
$$

This distribution allows us to calculate important performance measures of the system, such as the average number of customers in the system and the probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue.

#### Performance Measures in M/M/s Queueing System

The average number of customers in the system (in service and in queue) can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a stable system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. In the M/M/s queueing system, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}
$$

The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by Erlang's C formula, denoted by C(`s`, `λ`/`μ`). It is defined as:

$$
C(s, \lambda/\mu) = \frac{(s(\lambda/\mu)^s)}{s!} \frac{1}{(1-\rho)} \sum_{k=s}^{\infty} \frac{(s\rho)^{k-s}}{(k-s)!}
$$

This formula allows us to calculate the probability of congestion in the system, which is an important performance measure in many real-world applications.

In the next section, we will explore the performance measures of the M/M/s queueing system in more detail and discuss how they can be used to optimize the system for different applications.


## Chapter 9: Multiserver Queues:

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals and advanced applications of multiserver queues. These types of queues are characterized by having multiple servers, each with their own service time distribution. We will begin by discussing the M/M/s queueing system, which is a popular model for analyzing multiserver queues.

### Section: 9.2 M/G/s Queueing System:

The M/G/s queueing system is a type of multiserver queueing system that is commonly used in the analysis of communication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. Unlike the M/M/s queueing system, the M/G/s queueing system allows for a general service time distribution, making it a more realistic model for many real-world systems. In this section, we will define and analyze the M/G/s queueing system.

#### Definition and Analysis of M/G/s Queueing System

The M/G/s queueing system is a multiserver queueing system with a general service time distribution. This means that the service time for each server can follow any probability distribution, as long as it is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The arrival process, however, is still assumed to be memoryless.

To analyze the M/G/s queueing system, we use the concept of traffic intensity, denoted by `ρ`. It is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate `λ` to the service rate `sμ`. If `ρ < 1`, the system is stable, and the queue will not grow without bound. However, if `ρ > 1`, the queue will grow without bound, and the system is considered unstable.

The stationary distribution of the M/G/s queueing system can be calculated using the probability mass function `π`<sub>`k`</sub>, which represents the probability that the system contains `k` customers. It is given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & \text{if } k < s \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^k}{s^{k-s}}, & \text{if } k \geq s
\end{cases}
$$

This distribution allows us to calculate important performance measures of the system, such as the average number of customers in the system and the probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue.

#### Performance Measures in M/G/s Queueing System

The average number of customers in the system (in service and in queue) can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. In the M/G/s queueing system, the average time a customer spends in the system can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula:

$$
W = \frac{\rho}{s(1-\rho)}E[T]
$$

where `W` is the average time a customer spends in the system, `ρ` is the traffic intensity, `s` is the number of servers, and `E[T]` is the mean service time.

Another important performance measure is the probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue. This can be calculated using the Erlang-C formula:

$$
P_0 = \frac{\frac{\rho^s}{s!}}{\sum_{k=0}^{s-1}\frac{\rho^k}{k!} + \frac{\rho^s}{s!}(1-\frac{\rho}{s})}
$$

where `P_0` is the probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue.

### Subsection: 9.2a Definition and Analysis of M/G/s Queueing System

In this subsection, we will dive deeper into the definition and analysis of the M/G/s queueing system. As mentioned before, the M/G/s queueing system allows for a general service time distribution, making it a more realistic model for many real-world systems. However, this also means that the analysis of this system is more complex compared to the M/M/s queueing system.

To analyze the M/G/s queueing system, we use the concept of virtual time. This is an alternate monotonically increasing timescale that is used to model the finish time for each packet. By using virtual time, we can reduce the computational load of the algorithm, as it is unnecessary to recompute the finish time for previously queued packets.

The virtual finish time for a newly queued packet is given by the sum of the virtual start time plus the packet's size. The virtual start time is the maximum between the previous virtual finish time of the same queue and the current instant. This allows us to accurately model the order in which the transmissions must occur to meet the objectives of the full-featured model.

Using virtual time, we can calculate the finish time for each packet and determine the order in which they should be transmitted. This allows us to analyze the performance of the M/G/s queueing system and make important decisions regarding resource allocation and system design.

In conclusion, the M/G/s queueing system is a powerful tool for analyzing real-world systems with multiple servers and a general service time distribution. By using virtual time and other mathematical models, we can accurately predict the performance of these systems and make informed decisions to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. 


## Chapter 9: Multiserver Queues:

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals and advanced applications of multiserver queues. These types of queues are characterized by having multiple servers, each with their own service time distribution. We will begin by discussing the M/M/s queueing system, which is a popular model for analyzing multiserver queues.

### Section: 9.2 M/G/s Queueing System:

The M/G/s queueing system is a type of multiserver queueing system that is commonly used in the analysis of communication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. Unlike the M/M/s queueing system, the M/G/s queueing system allows for a general service time distribution, making it a more realistic model for many real-world systems. In this section, we will define and analyze the M/G/s queueing system.

#### Definition and Analysis of M/G/s Queueing System

The M/G/s queueing system is a multiserver queueing system with a general service time distribution. This means that the service time for each server can follow any probability distribution, as long as it is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The arrival process, however, is still assumed to be memoryless.

To analyze the M/G/s queueing system, we use the concept of traffic intensity, denoted by `ρ`. It is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate `λ` to the service rate `sμ`. If `ρ < 1`, the system is stable, and the queue will not grow without bound. However, if `ρ > 1`, the queue will grow without bound, and the system is considered unstable.

The stationary distribution of the M/G/s queueing system can be calculated using the probability mass function `π`<sub>`k`</sub>, which represents the probability that the system contains `k` customers. It is given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & \text{if } k < s \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^k}{s^{k-s}}, & \text{if } k \geq s
\end{cases}
$$

This distribution allows us to calculate important performance measures of the system, such as the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. These measures are essential for evaluating the performance of the system and making decisions on how to improve it.

### Subsection: 9.2b Performance Measures in M/G/s Queueing System

In this subsection, we will discuss the performance measures that are commonly used to evaluate the M/G/s queueing system. These measures are crucial for understanding the behavior of the system and making informed decisions on how to optimize it.

#### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted by `L`, is a measure of the system's utilization. It represents the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. It can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the arrival rate `λ` multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system, denoted by `W`.

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

#### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time, denoted by `W`, is a measure of the time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is an essential measure for evaluating the customer experience and the efficiency of the system. The average waiting time can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, or it can be derived from the stationary distribution `π`<sub>`k`</sub> as follows:

$$
W = \frac{\sum_{k=s}^{\infty} (k-s)\pi_k}{\lambda}
$$

#### Average Queue Length

The average queue length, denoted by `Q`, is a measure of the number of customers waiting in the queue. It is closely related to the average waiting time and can be calculated using the Little's Law formula or derived from the stationary distribution as follows:

$$
Q = \frac{\sum_{k=s}^{\infty} (k-s)\pi_k}{1-\pi_0}
$$

#### Utilization

The utilization, denoted by `ρ`, is a measure of the system's efficiency. It represents the proportion of time that the servers are busy serving customers. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{s\mu}
$$

where `s` is the number of servers and `μ` is the average service rate of each server.

#### Throughput

The throughput, denoted by `X`, is a measure of the system's capacity. It represents the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$
X = \lambda(1-P_0)
$$

where `P_0` is the probability that there are no customers in the system.

#### Response Time

The response time, denoted by `R`, is a measure of the time a customer spends in the system, including both the waiting time and the service time. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$
R = W + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

where `W` is the average waiting time and `μ` is the average service rate of each server.

#### Little's Law

Little's Law is a fundamental law in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in the system, the arrival rate, and the average time a customer spends in the system. It can be stated as follows:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

This law is essential for understanding the behavior of queueing systems and is widely used in performance analysis and optimization. 


## Chapter 9: Multiserver Queues:

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals and advanced applications of multiserver queues. These types of queues are characterized by having multiple servers, each with their own service time distribution. We will begin by discussing the G/M/s queueing system, which is a popular model for analyzing multiserver queues.

### Section: 9.3 G/M/s Queueing System:

The G/M/s queueing system is a type of multiserver queueing system that is commonly used in the analysis of communication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. Unlike the M/M/s queueing system, the G/M/s queueing system allows for a general arrival process, making it a more realistic model for many real-world systems. In this section, we will define and analyze the G/M/s queueing system.

#### Definition and Analysis of G/M/s Queueing System

The G/M/s queueing system is a multiserver queueing system with a general arrival process and a general service time distribution. This means that both the arrival process and the service time for each server can follow any probability distribution, as long as they are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This makes the G/M/s queueing system a more flexible and realistic model for many real-world systems.

To analyze the G/M/s queueing system, we use the concept of traffic intensity, denoted by `ρ`. It is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate `λ` to the service rate `sμ`. If `ρ < 1`, the system is stable, and the queue will not grow without bound. However, if `ρ > 1`, the queue will grow without bound, and the system is considered unstable.

The stationary distribution of the G/M/s queueing system can be calculated using the probability mass function `π`<sub>`k`</sub>, which represents the probability that the system contains `k` customers. It is given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & \text{if } k < s \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^k}{s^{k-s}}, & \text{if } k \geq s
\end{cases}
$$

This distribution allows us to calculate important performance measures of the system, such as the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. These measures are essential for understanding the behavior of the G/M/s queueing system and can help in making decisions to improve the system's performance.

One of the key advantages of the G/M/s queueing system is its ability to model a wide range of real-world systems. For example, in a communication network, the arrival process can represent the arrival of data packets, while the service time can represent the time it takes for a server to process the packet. In a manufacturing system, the arrival process can represent the arrival of orders, while the service time can represent the time it takes for a machine to process the order. By accurately modeling these systems, we can gain insights into their performance and make informed decisions to improve their efficiency.

In conclusion, the G/M/s queueing system is a powerful tool for analyzing multiserver queues in various real-world systems. Its flexibility and ability to model a wide range of systems make it a valuable tool for understanding and improving the performance of these systems.

If `ρ < 1`, the system is stable, and the queue will not grow without bound. However, if `ρ > 1`, the queue will grow without bound, and the system is considered unstable.

The stationary distribution of the G/M/s queueing system can be calculated using the probability mass function `π`<sub>`k`</sub>, which represents the probability that the system contains `k` customers. It is given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & \text{if } k < s \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^k}{s^{k-s}}, & \text{if } k \geq s
\end{cases}
$$

This distribution can be used to calculate various performance measures in the G/M/s queueing system. In this subsection, we will discuss some of the most commonly used performance measures.

##### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted by `L`, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
L = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k\pi_k
$$

This measure represents the average number of customers in the system, including those in service and those waiting in the queue.

##### Average Waiting Time in the Queue

The average waiting time in the queue, denoted by `W`, can be calculated using Little's Law:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

This measure represents the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served.

##### Average Response Time

The average response time, denoted by `R`, can be calculated by adding the average waiting time in the queue to the average service time:

$$
R = W + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

This measure represents the average amount of time a customer spends in the system, including both waiting and being served.

##### Utilization of the Servers

The utilization of the servers, denoted by `U`, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
U = \frac{\lambda}{s\mu}
$$

This measure represents the proportion of time that the servers are busy serving customers.

##### Probability of Waiting in the Queue

The probability of waiting in the queue, denoted by `P<sub>w</sub>`, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
P_w = \frac{\rho^s}{s!(1-\rho)}\pi_0
$$

This measure represents the probability that a customer will have to wait in the queue before being served.

##### Probability of Delay

The probability of delay, denoted by `P<sub>d</sub>`, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
P_d = \frac{\rho^s}{s!(1-\rho)}\pi_s
$$

This measure represents the probability that a customer will experience a delay in the system, including both waiting and being served.

##### Probability of System Being Full

The probability of the system being full, denoted by `P<sub>f</sub>`, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
P_f = \frac{\rho^s}{s!(1-\rho)}\pi_{s+1}
$$

This measure represents the probability that the system will reach its maximum capacity and be unable to accept any more customers.

In conclusion, the G/M/s queueing system is a versatile and realistic model for analyzing multiserver queues. By understanding and calculating these performance measures, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior and efficiency of the system.

These types of queues are characterized by having multiple servers, each with their own service time distribution. We will begin by discussing the G/M/s queueing system, which is a popular model for analyzing multiserver queues.

### Section: 9.4 G/G/s Queueing System:

The G/G/s queueing system is a type of multiserver queueing system that is commonly used in the analysis of communication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. Unlike the G/M/s queueing system, the G/G/s queueing system allows for a general arrival process and a general service time distribution. This makes it an even more flexible and realistic model for many real-world systems.

#### Subsection: 9.4a Definition and Analysis of G/G/s Queueing System

The G/G/s queueing system is a multiserver queueing system with a general arrival process and a general service time distribution. This means that both the arrival process and the service time for each server can follow any probability distribution, as long as they are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This makes the G/G/s queueing system a more flexible and realistic model for many real-world systems.

To analyze the G/G/s queueing system, we use the concept of traffic intensity, denoted by `ρ`. It is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate `λ` to the service rate `sμ`. If `ρ < 1`, the system is stable, and the queue will not grow without bound. However, if `ρ > 1`, the queue will grow without bound, and the system is considered unstable.

The stationary distribution of the G/G/s queueing system can be calculated using the probability mass function `π`<sub>`k`</sub>, which represents the probability that the system contains `k` customers. It is given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & \text{if } k < s \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^k}{s^{k-s}}, & \text{if } k \geq s
\end{cases}
$$

This distribution can be used to calculate important performance metrics such as the average number of customers in the system and the average waiting time. Additionally, the G/G/s queueing system can be used to model more complex systems, such as networks of fork-join queues and split-merge models.

One limitation of the G/G/s queueing system is that it assumes that all servers have the same service rate. In reality, this may not always be the case. To address this, a generalization of the G/G/s queueing system, known as the generalized (n,k) fork-join system, allows for different service rates for each server. This system is able to model more complex scenarios and has been shown to have bounds on the mean response time.

In conclusion, the G/G/s queueing system is a powerful tool for analyzing multiserver queues with general arrival and service time distributions. Its flexibility and ability to model complex systems make it a valuable tool for understanding and optimizing real-world systems.

\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^k}{s^{k-s}}, & \text{if } k \geq s
\end{cases}
$$

#### Subsection: 9.4b Performance Measures in G/G/s Queueing System

In addition to the stationary distribution, there are several other performance measures that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of a G/G/s queueing system. These include the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length.

The average number of customers in the system, denoted by `L`, can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that `L = λW`, where `W` is the average waiting time. The average waiting time can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which is given by:

$$
W = \frac{\rho}{s(1-\rho)}E[T]
$$

where `E[T]` is the mean service time.

The average queue length, denoted by `Lq`, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
Lq = \frac{\rho^2}{1-\rho}E[T]
$$

where `E[T]` is the mean service time.

These performance measures can be used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of a G/G/s queueing system and make informed decisions about system design and resource allocation.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime. This regime is named after two prominent researchers, Ward Whitt and William Halfin, who made significant contributions to the field of queueing theory. The Halfin-Whitt regime is a special case of the heavy-traffic regime, where the system is operating at high utilization levels. This regime is particularly interesting because it allows us to analyze queueing systems in a simplified manner, making it easier to understand and apply in real-world scenarios.

We will begin by discussing the fundamentals of the Halfin-Whitt regime, including its definition and key characteristics. We will then delve into the mathematical models used to analyze queues in this regime, such as the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model and the Halfin-Whitt heavy-traffic approximation. These models will help us gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of queues in this regime and how they differ from queues in other regimes.

Next, we will explore some advanced applications of the Halfin-Whitt regime. This includes analyzing the performance of various queueing systems, such as single-server queues, multi-server queues, and networks of queues, in the Halfin-Whitt regime. We will also discuss how the Halfin-Whitt regime can be used to optimize the performance of queueing systems and improve their efficiency.

Finally, we will conclude this chapter by discussing some current research and future directions in the field of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime. This will give readers an idea of the latest developments and potential areas for further exploration in this field. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals and advanced applications of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime, and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

### Section: - Section: 10.1 Heavy-Traffic Limits:

In this section, we will discuss the concept of heavy-traffic limits in the context of queueing theory. This concept was first introduced by Ward Whitt and William Halfin, and it has since become an important tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

#### Subsection: 10.1a Definition and Analysis of Heavy-Traffic Limits

Before we dive into the details of heavy-traffic limits, let us first define what we mean by the term "heavy-traffic." In queueing theory, heavy-traffic refers to a regime where the system is operating at high utilization levels, meaning that the arrival rate of customers is close to or exceeds the service rate of the system. This results in long queues and high waiting times for customers, which can have a significant impact on the performance of the system.

In the context of heavy-traffic limits, we are interested in studying the behavior of queueing systems as the arrival rate of customers approaches the service rate. This is known as the heavy-traffic limit, and it is often denoted by the symbol $\rho \to 1$, where $\rho$ represents the utilization level of the system. In this regime, the system is highly congested, and the queues are expected to grow without bound.

To analyze the behavior of queues in the heavy-traffic limit, we use mathematical models such as the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model and the Halfin-Whitt heavy-traffic approximation. These models allow us to gain insights into the performance of queueing systems in this regime and understand how they differ from queues in other regimes.

The Halfin-Whitt diffusion model is a stochastic process that describes the evolution of the queue length in a heavy-traffic queueing system. It takes into account the arrival and service rates, as well as the variability in these rates, to model the behavior of the queue length over time. This model has been widely used to analyze the performance of various queueing systems, such as single-server queues and multi-server queues, in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

Another commonly used model in the heavy-traffic limit is the Halfin-Whitt heavy-traffic approximation. This model simplifies the analysis of queueing systems by assuming that the arrival and service rates are constant and that the queue length is well-approximated by a deterministic function. This approximation has been shown to be accurate for a wide range of queueing systems, making it a useful tool for analyzing queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

In addition to understanding the behavior of queues in the heavy-traffic limit, we can also use this knowledge to optimize the performance of queueing systems. By analyzing the performance of various queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime, we can identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies and make improvements to reduce waiting times and increase system efficiency.

In conclusion, heavy-traffic limits play a crucial role in the analysis and optimization of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. By understanding the behavior of queues in this regime, we can make informed decisions to improve the performance of queueing systems and ensure efficient and smooth operations. 


## Chapter 10: Queues in Halfin-Whitt Regime:

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of heavy-traffic limits in the context of queueing theory. This concept was first introduced by Ward Whitt and William Halfin, and it has since become an important tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

### Section: 10.1 Heavy-Traffic Limits:

In this section, we will discuss the definition and analysis of heavy-traffic limits in queueing theory. We will also explore the mathematical models used to study the behavior of queueing systems in this regime.

#### Subsection: 10.1a Definition and Analysis of Heavy-Traffic Limits

It takes into account the arrival and service rates, as well as the variability in these rates, to model the behavior of the queue length over time. This model has been widely used to study the behavior of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime and has provided valuable insights into the performance of these systems.

Another important tool for analyzing queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime is the Halfin-Whitt heavy-traffic approximation. This approximation is based on the assumption that the arrival and service rates are large and that the variability in these rates is small. Under these conditions, the queue length can be approximated by a deterministic function, which simplifies the analysis of the system. This approximation has been shown to be accurate for a wide range of queueing systems and has been used extensively in the literature.

In addition to these mathematical models, there are also several performance measures that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime. These include the queue size, waiting time, and packet-loss rate. In general, heavy-tailed traffic negatively affects these performance measures, as the long-tailed distribution of arrival and service rates leads to more frequent and larger bursts of traffic, resulting in longer queues and higher waiting times.

However, it is important to note that heavy-tailedness does not necessarily imply long-range dependence. While long-range dependence can have a significant impact on the performance of queueing systems, it is the short-term correlations that affect performance in small buffers. Therefore, it is essential to consider both long-range dependence and short-term correlations when analyzing queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime.

In conclusion, heavy-traffic limits play a crucial role in the analysis of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. By using mathematical models and performance measures, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of these systems and understand how they differ from queues in other regimes. 


## Chapter 10: Queues in Halfin-Whitt Regime:

In this chapter, we will delve into the concept of heavy-traffic limits in queueing theory. This concept was first introduced by Ward Whitt and William Halfin, and it has since become an important tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

### Section: 10.2 Fluid Limit:

In this section, we will explore the fluid limit in the context of queueing theory. The fluid limit is a mathematical model used to study the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It is based on the concept of fluid dynamics, where the queue length is treated as a continuous variable rather than a discrete one.

#### Subsection: 10.2a Definition and Analysis of Fluid Limit

The fluid limit is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It allows us to gain insights into the behavior of queues as the arrival rate of customers approaches the service rate. This is denoted by the symbol $\rho \to 1$, where $\rho$ represents the utilization level of the system. In this regime, the system is highly congested, and the queues are expected to grow without bound.

To understand the fluid limit, we first need to define the concept of a fluid queue. A fluid queue is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of the queue length in a heavy-traffic queueing system. It is based on the assumption that the queue length can be treated as a continuous variable, similar to the flow of a fluid. This allows us to use tools from fluid dynamics to analyze the behavior of the queue.

The fluid limit is derived from the fluid queue model and is used to study the behavior of the queue as the arrival rate of customers approaches the service rate. It is a deterministic model that describes the evolution of the queue length over time. The fluid limit is often used in conjunction with the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model, which is a stochastic process that describes the evolution of the queue length in a heavy-traffic queueing system.

To analyze the behavior of queues in the fluid limit, we use the general equation of heat transfer and the equation for entropy production. These equations allow us to understand the flow of customers in the queue and the energy dissipation within the system. By studying these factors, we can gain insights into the performance of the queueing system and make predictions about its behavior in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

In conclusion, the fluid limit is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It allows us to gain insights into the behavior of queues as the arrival rate of customers approaches the service rate, and it is often used in conjunction with other mathematical models to provide a comprehensive understanding of queueing systems in this regime.

In the Halfin-Whitt regime, the system is highly congested, and the queues are expected to grow without bound. However, the fluid limit allows us to determine if the system is stable or not. If the fluid limit is stable, then the queue length will remain bounded, and the system will be able to handle the incoming traffic. On the other hand, if the fluid limit is unstable, then the queue length will grow without bound, and the system will eventually fail.

Another advantage of using the fluid limit is that it allows us to analyze the performance of the system. By studying the fluid limit, we can gain insights into the average queue length, waiting time, and other performance metrics of the system. This information is crucial for designing and optimizing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

In conclusion, the fluid limit is a powerful tool for modeling queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

### Section: 10.3 Diffusion Limit:

In the previous section, we explored the fluid limit as a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. In this section, we will delve into the diffusion limit, another important mathematical model used in the study of queueing systems.

#### Subsection: 10.3a Definition and Analysis of Diffusion Limit

The diffusion limit is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It is based on the concept of diffusion, which is a process that describes the random movement of particles in a fluid. In the context of queueing theory, the diffusion limit is used to study the behavior of queues as the arrival rate of customers approaches the service rate, denoted by $\rho \to 1$.

To understand the diffusion limit, we first need to define the diffusion map. The diffusion map is a transition matrix of a Markov chain that represents the one-step transition probability from one state to another. In the context of queueing theory, the states represent the queue length, and the transition probabilities represent the arrival and service rates.

From the diffusion map, we can construct the diffusion matrix, which is a version of the graph Laplacian matrix. This matrix is used to define a new kernel, which is then normalized using the graph Laplacian normalization. This results in the diffusion matrix, which is a diagonal matrix that represents the probability of transitioning from one state to another.

The diffusion limit is derived from the diffusion matrix and is used to study the behavior of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It is a deterministic model that describes the evolution of the queue length over time. Similar to the fluid limit, the diffusion limit is often used in conjunction with the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model, which is a stochastic model that takes into account the random nature of queueing systems.

The eigendecomposition of the diffusion matrix yields a sequence of eigenvalues and biorthogonal right and left eigenvectors. These eigenvectors represent the geometric structure of the queueing system at larger and larger scales, with the eigenvalues decaying as the scale increases. This allows us to gain insights into the behavior of the queue as the arrival rate of customers approaches the service rate.

In conclusion, the diffusion limit is an important mathematical model used in the study of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of queues as the system becomes highly congested, and the queues grow without bound. In the next section, we will explore the applications of the diffusion limit in queueing theory.

Similar to the fluid limit, the diffusion limit is often used in conjunction with the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model, which is a stochastic model that approximates the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

The Halfin-Whitt diffusion model is based on the assumption that the arrival and service rates are close to each other, with the arrival rate being slightly higher than the service rate. This results in a heavy traffic scenario, where the queue length is constantly fluctuating around a mean value. The diffusion limit is used to approximate this behavior and provide insights into the performance of the queueing system.

One of the main advantages of using the diffusion limit is that it allows for a more detailed analysis of the queueing system compared to the fluid limit. The diffusion limit takes into account the stochastic nature of the arrival and service processes, providing a more accurate representation of the system's behavior. This is especially useful in scenarios where the arrival and service rates are highly variable.

To approximate a queueing system using the diffusion limit, we first need to determine the diffusion matrix and the corresponding diffusion limit equation. This can be done by solving the system of equations that define the diffusion matrix, as shown in the previous section. Once the diffusion matrix is determined, the diffusion limit equation can be solved to obtain the steady-state queue length distribution.

In conclusion, the diffusion limit is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It provides a more accurate representation of the system's behavior compared to the fluid limit and allows for a detailed analysis of the queueing system. By approximating the behavior of queueing systems in heavy traffic scenarios, the diffusion limit helps us gain insights into the performance of these systems and make informed decisions for their optimization.

## Chapter 10: Queues in Halfin-Whitt Regime:

### Section: 10.4 Stationary Distribution:

In the previous section, we explored the diffusion limit as a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. In this section, we will delve into the concept of stationary distribution, which is an important aspect of queueing theory.

#### Subsection: 10.4a Definition and Analysis of Stationary Distribution

In a discrete-time Markov chain, a distribution $\pi$ is considered a stationary distribution if and only if $\pi P = \pi$, where $P$ is the stochastic matrix of the Markov chain. This condition implies that $\pi P^n = \pi$ and therefore, if the Markov chain $(X_n, n \in \mathbb{N})$ has an initial distribution $X_0 = \pi$, then $X_n = \pi$ in distribution for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

For a Markov chain to have a stationary distribution, it must be irreducible and positive recurrent. In this case, the unique stationary distribution is given by $\pi_i = \frac{1}{M_i}$, where $M_i = \mathbb{E}(T_i)$ is the mean recurrence time of state $i$. However, if the Markov chain has more than one closed communicating class, its stationary distributions will not be unique. Each closed communicating class will have its own unique stationary distribution, and the overall set of invariant measures of the chain will be the set of all convex combinations of these distributions.

In the case of aperiodic states, the limit of $p_{jj}^{(n)}$ as $n \to \infty$ is equal to $\frac{C}{M_j}$, where $C$ is a constant. For any other state $i$, the limit of $p_{ij}^{(n)}$ as $n \to \infty$ is equal to $C \frac{f_{ij}}{M_j}$, where $f_{ij}$ is the probability that the chain ever visits state $j$ if it starts at state $i$.

However, if a state $i$ is periodic with period $k > 1$, the limit of $p_{ii}^{(n)}$ as $n \to \infty$ does not exist. Instead, the limit of $p_{ii}^{(kn+r)}$ as $n \to \infty$ exists for every integer $r$.

In the previous section, we discussed the diffusion limit, which is a mathematical model used to study the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. The diffusion limit is derived from the diffusion matrix, which is constructed from the diffusion map of a Markov chain. This matrix is used to define a new kernel, which is then normalized using the graph Laplacian normalization. The resulting diffusion matrix is a diagonal matrix that represents the probability of transitioning from one state to another.

The diffusion limit is a deterministic model that describes the evolution of the queue length over time. It is often used in conjunction with the Halfin-Whitt diffusion model, which is a stochastic model that takes into account the randomness of arrivals and service times in a queueing system.

This condition implies that $\pi P^n = \pi$ and therefore, if the Markov chain $(X_n, n \in \mathbb{N})$ has an initial distribution $X_0 = \pi$, then $X_n = \pi$ in distribution for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Each closed communicating class will have its own unique stationary distribution, and the overall set of invariant measures of the chain will be the set of all convex combinations of these distributions.

For any other state $i$, the limit of $p_{ij}^{(n)}$ as $n \to \infty$ is equal to $C \frac{f_{ij}}{M_j}$, where $f_{ij}$ is the probability that the chain ever visits state $j$ if it starts at state $i$.

However, if a state $i$ is periodic with period $k > 1$, the limit of $p_{ii}^{(n)}$ as $n \to \infty$ does not exist. Instead, the limit of $p_{ii}^{(kn+r)}$ as $n \to \infty$ exists for every $r \in \{0, 1, ..., k-1\}$ and is equal to $\frac{C}{M_i}$, where $C$ is a constant. This means that the probability of being in state $i$ at any given time is equal to the probability of being in state $i$ at any other time, regardless of the starting state. This is known as the periodicity property of stationary distributions.

In queueing theory, the stationary distribution is an important concept as it allows us to analyze the long-term behavior of a queueing system. By understanding the stationary distribution, we can determine the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and other important performance measures. In the next subsection, we will explore how to estimate the stationary distribution in queueing systems using Buzen's algorithm.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored various aspects of queueing theory, from its fundamental concepts to its practical applications. We have discussed single-server and multi-server systems, as well as different types of queues such as M/M/1, M/M/c, and M/G/1. In this chapter, we will delve into the world of open Jackson networks, which are complex queueing systems that consist of interconnected queues. These networks are widely used in real-world scenarios, such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and transportation systems.

Open Jackson networks are named after John Jackson, who first introduced them in 1957. They are a type of queueing network where customers can enter and exit the system at any point, unlike closed networks where customers are confined to a specific queue. This allows for a more realistic representation of real-world systems, where customers can choose different paths and queues to reach their destination. Open Jackson networks are also known as open queueing networks or open queueing systems.

In this chapter, we will cover the fundamentals of open Jackson networks, including their structure, characteristics, and performance measures. We will also explore various analytical methods used to analyze these networks, such as mean value analysis and queueing network models. Additionally, we will discuss the applications of open Jackson networks in different industries and how they can be used to optimize system performance and improve customer satisfaction.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of open Jackson networks and their role in queueing theory. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in analyzing and modeling these complex queueing systems, and will be able to apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios. So let's dive into the world of open Jackson networks and discover the fascinating world of interconnected queues. 


## Chapter 11: Open Jackson Networks:

### Section: 11.1 Jackson Networks:

Open Jackson networks, also known as open queueing networks, are a type of queueing network where customers can enter and exit the system at any point. This allows for a more realistic representation of real-world systems, where customers can choose different paths and queues to reach their destination. These networks are widely used in various industries, such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and transportation systems.

### Subsection: 11.1a Definition and Analysis of Jackson Networks

In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, a Jackson network is a class of queueing network where the equilibrium distribution is particularly simple to compute as the network has a product-form solution. It was first introduced by John Jackson in 1957 and has since been a significant development in the theory of networks of queues.

A Jackson network consists of a number of nodes, where each node represents a queue in which the service rate can be both node-dependent and state-dependent. This means that different nodes can have different service rates, and the service rates can also change depending on the queue lengths. Jobs travel among the nodes following a fixed routing matrix, and all jobs at each node belong to a single "class" with the same service-time distribution and routing mechanism. This allows for a more simplified analysis of the network.

To analyze a Jackson network, we first need to define the arrival rate and service rate at each node. The arrival rate is the rate at which customers enter the system, while the service rate is the rate at which customers are served. These rates can be constant or vary depending on the state of the queue. Once these rates are defined, we can use various analytical methods to calculate the performance measures of the network, such as the average queue length, waiting time, and throughput.

One of the most commonly used methods to analyze Jackson networks is mean value analysis. This method involves calculating the mean values of the queue lengths and waiting times at each node and then using these values to determine the overall performance of the network. Another approach is to use queueing network models, which involve representing the network as a set of interconnected queues and using mathematical models to analyze its behavior.

The applications of Jackson networks are vast and diverse. They are used in telecommunication networks to model call centers and data networks, in computer systems to analyze the performance of servers and networks, and in transportation systems to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. By understanding the behavior of these networks, we can make informed decisions to improve system performance and customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, Jackson networks are a fundamental concept in queueing theory and have numerous real-world applications. Their simple product-form solution and various analytical methods make them a valuable tool for analyzing complex queueing systems. In the next section, we will explore the characteristics and structure of Jackson networks in more detail. 


## Chapter 11: Open Jackson Networks:

### Section: 11.1 Jackson Networks:

Open Jackson networks, also known as open queueing networks, are a type of queueing network where customers can enter and exit the system at any point. This allows for a more realistic representation of real-world systems, where customers can choose different paths and queues to reach their destination. These networks are widely used in various industries, such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and transportation systems.

### Subsection: 11.1b Modeling Network Performance using Jackson Networks

In order to effectively analyze and understand the performance of open Jackson networks, it is important to have a solid understanding of how to model them. This involves defining the arrival and service rates at each node, as well as utilizing various analytical methods to calculate performance measures.

#### Defining Arrival and Service Rates

The arrival rate at a node in an open Jackson network is the rate at which customers enter the system. This can be a constant rate or vary depending on the state of the queue. For example, in a telecommunication network, the arrival rate may increase during peak hours when more customers are using the network. The service rate, on the other hand, is the rate at which customers are served. This can also be a constant rate or vary depending on the state of the queue. For instance, in a transportation system, the service rate may decrease if there is heavy traffic or delays.

#### Analytical Methods for Performance Measures

Once the arrival and service rates are defined, there are various analytical methods that can be used to calculate performance measures of the network. These include the use of Markov chains, queuing theory, and simulation techniques. Markov chains are a mathematical tool used to model the behavior of a system over time, and they can be used to analyze the performance of open Jackson networks. Queuing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, is also commonly used to analyze queueing networks. It involves using mathematical models to study the behavior of queues and can be applied to open Jackson networks to calculate performance measures such as average queue length, waiting time, and throughput. Simulation techniques, on the other hand, involve creating a computer model of the network and running simulations to observe its behavior and calculate performance measures.

#### Advantages of Modeling Network Performance using Jackson Networks

Modeling network performance using Jackson networks has several advantages. Firstly, it allows for a more realistic representation of real-world systems, as customers can enter and exit the system at any point. This is especially useful in industries such as telecommunication networks, where customers may have different paths and queues to reach their destination. Additionally, the product-form solution of Jackson networks makes it easier to analyze and calculate performance measures compared to other types of queueing networks. This allows for a more efficient and accurate understanding of network performance. Furthermore, the use of analytical methods such as Markov chains and queuing theory allows for a deeper understanding of the behavior of the network and can help identify potential areas for improvement.

In conclusion, modeling network performance using Jackson networks is a crucial aspect of understanding and analyzing the behavior of open queueing networks. By defining arrival and service rates and utilizing various analytical methods, we can gain valuable insights into the performance of these networks and make informed decisions for improvement. 


## Chapter 11: Open Jackson Networks:

### Section: 11.2 Routing Probability:

In open Jackson networks, customers have the freedom to choose their own paths and queues to reach their destination. This means that the routing probability, or the probability that a customer will choose a specific path or queue, plays a crucial role in the performance of the network. In this section, we will define and calculate the routing probability in open Jackson networks.

#### Definition and Calculation of Routing Probability

The routing probability, denoted by $P_{ij}$, is the probability that a customer will choose to go from node $i$ to node $j$. This probability is influenced by various factors such as the arrival and service rates at each node, the number of customers in each queue, and the routing strategy used in the network.

To calculate the routing probability, we can use the following formula:

$$
P_{ij} = \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i + \mu_i} \cdot \frac{\mu_j}{\sum_{k=1}^{N} \mu_k}
$$

Where:
- $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate at node $i$
- $\mu_i$ is the service rate at node $i$
- $N$ is the total number of nodes in the network

This formula is based on the assumption that customers choose their paths and queues based on the shortest expected waiting time. In other words, customers will choose the path and queue that will result in the shortest time to reach their destination.

Let's consider an example to better understand the calculation of routing probability. Suppose we have an open Jackson network with three nodes, $A$, $B$, and $C$. The arrival rates at these nodes are $\lambda_A = 2$, $\lambda_B = 3$, and $\lambda_C = 4$. The service rates at these nodes are $\mu_A = 1$, $\mu_B = 2$, and $\mu_C = 3$. Using the formula above, we can calculate the routing probabilities as follows:

$$
P_{AB} = \frac{2}{2+1} \cdot \frac{2}{1+2+3} = \frac{4}{15} \approx 0.267
$$

$$
P_{AC} = \frac{2}{2+1} \cdot \frac{3}{1+2+3} = \frac{6}{15} = 0.4
$$

$$
P_{BA} = \frac{3}{3+2} \cdot \frac{1}{1+2+3} = \frac{3}{15} = 0.2
$$

$$
P_{BC} = \frac{3}{3+2} \cdot \frac{3}{1+2+3} = \frac{9}{15} = 0.6
$$

$$
P_{CA} = \frac{4}{4+3} \cdot \frac{1}{1+2+3} = \frac{4}{15} \approx 0.267
$$

$$
P_{CB} = \frac{4}{4+3} \cdot \frac{2}{1+2+3} = \frac{8}{15} \approx 0.533
$$

We can see that the routing probabilities are influenced by the arrival and service rates at each node. In this example, node $C$ has the highest arrival rate and service rate, resulting in higher routing probabilities for paths involving node $C$. This information can be used to optimize the performance of the network by adjusting the arrival and service rates at each node.

In conclusion, the routing probability is an important factor in open Jackson networks and can be calculated using the formula provided. By understanding and optimizing the routing probabilities, we can improve the performance of these networks in various industries.


## Chapter 11: Open Jackson Networks:

### Section: 11.2 Routing Probability:

In open Jackson networks, customers have the freedom to choose their own paths and queues to reach their destination. This means that the routing probability, or the probability that a customer will choose a specific path or queue, plays a crucial role in the performance of the network. In this section, we will define and calculate the routing probability in open Jackson networks.

#### Definition and Calculation of Routing Probability

The routing probability, denoted by $P_{ij}$, is the probability that a customer will choose to go from node $i$ to node $j$. This probability is influenced by various factors such as the arrival and service rates at each node, the number of customers in each queue, and the routing strategy used in the network.

To calculate the routing probability, we can use the following formula:

$$
P_{ij} = \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i + \mu_i} \cdot \frac{\mu_j}{\sum_{k=1}^{N} \mu_k}
$$

Where:
- $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate at node $i$
- $\mu_i$ is the service rate at node $i$
- $N$ is the total number of nodes in the network

This formula is based on the assumption that customers choose their paths and queues based on the shortest expected waiting time. In other words, customers will choose the path and queue that will result in the shortest time to reach their destination.

Let's consider an example to better understand the calculation of routing probability. Suppose we have an open Jackson network with three nodes, $A$, $B$, and $C$. The arrival rates at these nodes are $\lambda_A = 2$, $\lambda_B = 3$, and $\lambda_C = 4$. The service rates at these nodes are $\mu_A = 1$, $\mu_B = 2$, and $\mu_C = 3$. Using the formula above, we can calculate the routing probabilities as follows:

$$
P_{AB} = \frac{2}{2+1} \cdot \frac{2}{1+2+3} = \frac{4}{15} \approx 0.267
$$

$$
P_{AC} = \frac{2}{2+1} \cdot \frac{3}{1+2+3} = \frac{6}{15} = 0.4
$$

$$
P_{BA} = \frac{3}{3+2} \cdot \frac{1}{1+2+3} = \frac{3}{15} = 0.2
$$

$$
P_{BC} = \frac{3}{3+2} \cdot \frac{3}{1+2+3} = \frac{9}{15} = 0.6
$$

$$
P_{CA} = \frac{4}{4+3} \cdot \frac{1}{1+2+3} = \frac{4}{15} \approx 0.267
$$

$$
P_{CB} = \frac{4}{4+3} \cdot \frac{2}{1+2+3} = \frac{8}{15} \approx 0.533
$$

As we can see, the routing probabilities depend on the arrival and service rates at each node. In this example, node $C$ has the highest arrival rate and service rate, resulting in higher routing probabilities for paths involving node $C$. This information can be used to optimize the performance of the network by adjusting the arrival and service rates at each node.

#### Other Factors Affecting Routing Probability

Apart from the arrival and service rates, there are other factors that can affect the routing probability in open Jackson networks. These include the number of customers in each queue and the routing strategy used in the network.

The number of customers in each queue can affect the routing probability as it can lead to longer waiting times and potentially influence customers to choose a different path or queue. This is especially important in networks with high traffic and congestion.

The routing strategy used in the network can also have a significant impact on the routing probability. Different strategies, such as shortest expected waiting time or round-robin, can result in different routing probabilities and ultimately affect the performance of the network.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the routing probability is a crucial factor in the performance of open Jackson networks. It is influenced by various factors such as arrival and service rates, number of customers in each queue, and routing strategy. By understanding and calculating the routing probability, we can optimize the performance of the network and improve the overall customer experience.
