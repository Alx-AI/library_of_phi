In the field of architecture, the design process has traditionally been a manual and iterative one. Architects would start with a concept, sketch it out on paper, and then refine it through multiple iterations until a final design was reached. This process was time-consuming and often limited by the architect's own creativity and experience. However, with the advancement of technology, the use of computational tools in architectural design has become increasingly prevalent.

This chapter will provide an introduction to traditional design methods in architecture and how they have evolved with the integration of computational tools. We will explore the principles and processes of traditional design, including the use of hand-drawn sketches, physical models, and manual calculations. We will also discuss the limitations of traditional design and how computational tools have helped to overcome these limitations.

Furthermore, this chapter will also touch upon the various applications of computational tools in architectural design. From parametric design to generative design, we will explore how these tools have revolutionized the way architects approach the design process. We will also discuss the benefits and challenges of using computational tools in architecture, and how they have impacted the field as a whole.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a foundation for understanding the role of computational tools in architectural design. By exploring traditional design methods and their evolution, we can gain a better understanding of the principles and processes that have shaped the field of architecture. This will set the stage for the rest of the book, where we will delve deeper into the various applications and techniques of computational design in architecture.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design

### Section 1.1: Traditional Design Principles

#### Subsection 1.1a: History of Traditional Design

The history of traditional design in architecture can be traced back to the 1700s in Western fashion. During this time, there was a strong emphasis on classicism and the use of traditional design elements in both fashion and architecture. This trend continued into the 1730s, with architects and industrial designers drawing inspiration from existing buildings and products to create new and innovative designs.

The traditional design approach is rooted in the belief that traditional designs are timeless and functional, making them the preferred typology for buildings and products. This approach also values the preservation and restoration of existing buildings and products, as well as the use of vernacular design elements.

The design value of restoration and preservation is based on the commitment to preserve the best of buildings and products for future generations. This often involves restoring a building or product to its original design, and is rooted in three perspectives: historical, cultural, and aesthetic. By preserving these elements, we can gain a better understanding of our past and appreciate the cultural significance of traditional designs.

The vernacular design value is based on the use of local materials and techniques to create functional and sustainable designs. This approach values the integration of traditional design elements into modern architecture, creating a sense of continuity and connection to the past.

Overall, the history of traditional design in architecture is a rich and diverse one, with a strong emphasis on preserving and reusing existing design elements. This approach has influenced the principles and processes of traditional design, and continues to shape the field of architecture today. In the following sections, we will explore these principles and processes in more detail, as well as the role of computational tools in traditional design.


# Architectural Construction and Computation: Principles, Processes, and Applications

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design

### Section 1.1: Traditional Design Principles

#### Subsection 1.1b: Principles and Elements

Traditional design principles are the fundamental concepts that guide the creation of traditional designs in architecture. These principles are rooted in the belief that traditional designs are timeless and functional, making them the preferred typology for buildings and products. They also value the preservation and restoration of existing buildings and products, as well as the use of vernacular design elements.

One of the key principles of traditional design is symmetry. This principle is based on the idea that a design should be balanced and harmonious, with equal weight and proportion on both sides. This can be seen in the use of symmetrical facades in traditional buildings, where the left and right sides mirror each other.

Another important principle is hierarchy. This refers to the organization of elements within a design, with some elements being more dominant and others being subordinate. In traditional design, this can be seen in the use of a central focal point, such as a grand entrance or a prominent feature, to create a sense of hierarchy and importance.

Proportion is also a key principle in traditional design. This refers to the relationship between different elements in a design, and how they relate to each other in terms of size and scale. Traditional designs often use the golden ratio, a mathematical ratio that is believed to create the most aesthetically pleasing proportions.

The use of traditional design elements is also a fundamental principle. These elements, such as columns, arches, and pediments, are derived from classical architecture and are used to create a sense of timelessness and grandeur in traditional designs.

In addition to these principles, traditional design also values the use of local materials and techniques, as well as the integration of traditional design elements into modern architecture. This not only creates a sense of continuity and connection to the past, but also promotes sustainability and cultural preservation.

Overall, these principles guide the creation of traditional designs and are essential to understanding the history and significance of traditional design in architecture. In the next section, we will explore the history of traditional design in more detail and how it has influenced the principles and processes of traditional design.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design

### Section 1.1: Traditional Design Principles

#### Subsection 1.1c: Traditional vs. Modern Design

In the world of architecture and industrial design, there has always been a debate between traditional and modern approaches. While some argue that modern design is the way of the future, others believe that traditional design principles hold timeless value and should continue to be used in the creation of buildings and products.

One of the main differences between traditional and modern design is the approach to inspiration. Traditional design values the use of existing design elements and styles, often drawing from classical architecture and local vernacular. This approach values the preservation and restoration of existing buildings and products, as well as the use of traditional design elements to create a sense of timelessness and grandeur.

On the other hand, modern design often focuses on creating new and innovative solutions, using technology and contemporary materials to push the boundaries of design. This approach values functionality and efficiency, often resulting in minimalist and sleek designs.

Another key difference between traditional and modern design is the use of symmetry. Traditional design principles value symmetry as a way to create balance and harmony, while modern design often embraces asymmetry and irregularity as a way to create visual interest.

In terms of hierarchy, traditional design often uses a central focal point to create a sense of importance and dominance, while modern design may distribute elements more evenly to create a sense of equality.

Proportion is also approached differently in traditional and modern design. Traditional design often follows the golden ratio, while modern design may use more abstract and unconventional proportions.

Ultimately, the choice between traditional and modern design comes down to personal preference and the specific needs of a project. Both approaches have their own unique strengths and can result in stunning and functional designs. In this book, we will explore the principles, processes, and applications of traditional design, and how they can be combined with computational tools to create innovative and sustainable solutions.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design

### Section 1.2: Design Process

#### Subsection 1.2a: Conceptualization

In the design process, conceptualization is a crucial step that involves the formation of a higher level abstraction to facilitate the discussion and comparison of various ontologies. This allows for knowledge sharing and reuse, as each ontology based on the same overarching conceptualization can be mapped into specific elements and their relationships.

However, the issue of how to describe the conceptualization in terms that can encompass multiple ontologies has been a longstanding problem, often referred to as the "Tower of Babel" problem. This problem arises when individuals using different ontologies try to communicate with each other. While there is no general resolution to this problem, there are different approaches that can be taken, such as a "bottom-up" or "top-down" approach.

In more artificial situations, such as information systems, the idea of a conceptualization and its ontological commitment to various ontologies is possible. This involves the steps of forming a conceptualization and its ontologies, which can be compared to the process of expressing a process in pseudocode and implementing it in different formal computer languages. The pseudocode serves as a higher level abstraction, making it easier to understand the instructions and compare implementations, while the formal languages allow for the compilation of the ideas as computer instructions.

Similarly, in mathematics, a very general formulation can be illustrated with more specialized examples, serving as "applications" of the conceptualization. For instance, aspects of a function space can be demonstrated using a vector space or a topological space, introducing interpretations of the "elements" of the conceptualization and additional relationships.

In the context of architectural design, conceptualization plays a crucial role in the creation of buildings and products. It allows for the comparison and integration of different design elements and styles, drawing from traditional and modern approaches. While traditional design values the use of existing design elements and styles, modern design often focuses on creating new and innovative solutions. However, both approaches can benefit from the use of a conceptualization, as it allows for the preservation of traditional design principles while also pushing the boundaries of modern design.

After the conceptualization stage, the design process moves on to the development stage. This is where the initial ideas and concepts are refined and transformed into more concrete designs. The design development stage is crucial in ensuring that the final design meets all the necessary requirements and is feasible to construct.

One approach to design development is the "bottom-up" approach, where the design is developed by starting with the individual elements and gradually building up to the overall design. This approach allows for a more detailed and thorough understanding of each element and how they fit together to form the final design.

Another approach is the "top-down" approach, where the design is developed by starting with the overall concept and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable elements. This approach allows for a more holistic view of the design and ensures that all elements are aligned with the overall concept.

In architectural design, the design development stage involves creating detailed drawings and models of the proposed design. This allows for a better visualization of the final product and helps identify any potential issues or challenges that may arise during construction.

The design development stage also involves considering various factors such as structural integrity, building codes and regulations, and cost-effectiveness. This ensures that the final design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and practical.

In addition to traditional design methods, the use of computational tools and techniques has become increasingly prevalent in the design development stage. These tools allow for more efficient and accurate design iterations, as well as the exploration of complex design possibilities that may not have been possible with traditional methods.

Overall, the design development stage is a crucial step in the design process, as it bridges the gap between conceptualization and construction. It allows for the refinement and optimization of the initial ideas, resulting in a well-developed and feasible design that meets all the necessary requirements.

## Chapter 16: Field Trip:

Field trips are an essential part of the learning process for architecture students, as they provide a hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the principles and processes involved in the construction of buildings. In this section, we will focus on the third type of field trip commonly undertaken in the field of architecture - documenting field trip findings.

### Section: 16.3 Documenting Field Trip Findings:

After observing construction techniques on a field trip, it is important for architecture students to document their findings. This allows them to reflect on their observations and further analyze the construction methods and materials used. In this section, we will discuss the importance of note-taking during a field trip and different methods for documenting findings.

#### 16.3a Note Taking

Note-taking is a crucial skill for architecture students, especially during a field trip. It allows them to record important information and observations in an organized and efficient manner. There are various methods of note-taking, such as linear note-taking and outlining, each with its own advantages.

##### 16.3a.1 Linear Note-taking

Linear note-taking is the process of recording information in the order in which it is received. This method is commonly used during lectures or presentations, but it can also be applied during a field trip. Linear notes are typically chronological outlines of the observations made, making it easier to review and analyze the information later on.

However, there is a risk of simply transcribing everything that is being said or shown, which can be overwhelming and unhelpful. To avoid this, it is important to focus on key points and use shorthand or symbols to condense information.

##### 16.3a.2 Outlining

Outlining is another common note-taking system that can be useful during a field trip. It involves organizing notes and thoughts in a structured and logical manner, making it easier to digest a large amount of information in a short period of time. This method is particularly useful for classes that involve complex formulas and graphs, such as mathematics or chemistry.

Outlines typically use headings and bullets to structure information, with different levels indicated by Roman numerals, letters of the alphabet, and Arabic numerals. However, this method may have limitations in non-digital form, as it can be difficult to go back and insert additional information. To overcome this, adaptive systems such as using the reverse side of a page or leaving large spaces in between items can be used.

Modular construction has consistently been at least 20 percent faster than traditional on-site builds. Currently, the design process of modular construction projects tends to take longer than that of traditional building. This is because modular construction is a fairly new technology and not many architects and engineers have experience working with it. In fewer words, the industry has not yet learned how to work this way. It is expected of design firms to develop module libraries which would assist in the automatization of this process. These modules libraries would hold various pre-designed 2D panels and 3D structures which would be digitally assembled to create standardized structures.

The foundations of a structure are a crucial part of its rigidity. The magnitude and complexity of such will vary depending on the size, and overall weight of the structure. Therefore, the weight difference of a traditionally built house and a prefabricated structure will mean that foundations needed will be smaller and faster to build.

Off-site manufacturing is the pinnacle of modular construction. The ability to coordinate and repeat activities in a factory along with the increased help of automation result in largely faster manufacturing times than those of on-site building. A large time saver is the ability to parallelly work on the foundation of a structure and the manufacturing of the structure itself. This would be impossible with traditional construction. The on-site construction is radically simplified. The assembly of pre-fabricated components is as simple as assembling the 3D modules, and connecting the services to main site connections. This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of errors and delays.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design:

### Section 1.1 Traditional Design Principles:

Traditional design principles have been the foundation of architectural design for centuries. These principles, including proportion, scale, and symmetry, have stood the test of time and continue to be relevant in modern architectural design. They provide a framework for creating aesthetically pleasing and functional structures.

#### Subsection 1.1b: Principles and Elements

In traditional design, there are several key principles that guide the creation of a structure. These principles include proportion, scale, symmetry, and balance. Each of these principles plays a crucial role in the overall design and must be carefully considered by the architect.

Proportion refers to the relationship between different elements within a design. It is the key to creating a harmonious and visually appealing structure. The use of proportion can be seen in the Parthenon, where the columns are carefully spaced and sized to create a sense of balance and harmony.

Scale is another important principle in traditional design. It refers to the size of elements in relation to the overall structure. For example, in a building, the size of the windows and doors must be carefully considered in relation to the size of the walls and roof. This ensures that the structure is visually balanced and functional.

Symmetry is the principle of creating balance and harmony through the use of mirrored or repeated elements. This can be seen in the design of many traditional buildings, where the left and right sides are identical or nearly identical. Symmetry creates a sense of order and stability in a structure.

Balance is the final principle of traditional design. It refers to the distribution of visual weight within a structure. A well-balanced design will have elements that are evenly distributed and create a sense of equilibrium. This can be achieved through the use of symmetry, but also through the careful placement of elements such as windows, doors, and columns.

Understanding and applying these principles is essential for creating a successful traditional design. However, it is also important to consider the elements that make up a structure. These elements include materials, form, and function.

Materials play a crucial role in traditional design. The choice of materials can greatly impact the overall look and feel of a structure. For example, the use of marble in the Parthenon gives it a grand and elegant appearance, while the use of wood in a traditional Japanese temple creates a sense of warmth and simplicity.

Form refers to the shape and structure of a building. Traditional design often incorporates geometric shapes and symmetrical forms, as seen in the Taj Mahal and the Great Pyramids of Giza. The form of a structure should also be functional, allowing for efficient use of space and meeting the needs of its occupants.

Function is the final element of traditional design. A successful design must not only be visually appealing but also functional for its intended purpose. This requires careful consideration of the needs and activities of the building's occupants, as well as the surrounding environment.

In conclusion, traditional design principles and elements are essential for creating aesthetically pleasing and functional structures. By understanding and applying these principles, architects can create timeless designs that stand the test of time. In the next section, we will explore the history of traditional design and how it has evolved over time.


## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design:

Traditional design has been the cornerstone of architectural practice for centuries, providing a solid foundation for creating aesthetically pleasing and functional structures. In this chapter, we will explore the principles, processes, and applications of traditional design, and how they have evolved over time.

### Section 1.1 Traditional Design Principles:

Traditional design principles have stood the test of time and continue to be relevant in modern architectural design. These principles, including proportion, scale, symmetry, and balance, provide a framework for creating harmonious and visually appealing structures.

#### Subsection 1.1b: Principles and Elements

In traditional design, there are several key principles that guide the creation of a structure. These principles include proportion, scale, symmetry, and balance. Each of these principles plays a crucial role in the overall design and must be carefully considered by the architect.

Proportion refers to the relationship between different elements within a design. It is the key to creating a harmonious and visually appealing structure. The use of proportion can be seen in the Parthenon, where the columns are carefully spaced and sized to create a sense of balance and harmony. Mathematically, proportion can be expressed as the ratio of one element to another, such as the ratio of the height of a column to its diameter.

Scale is another important principle in traditional design. It refers to the size of elements in relation to the overall structure. For example, in a building, the size of the windows and doors must be carefully considered in relation to the size of the walls and roof. This ensures that the structure is visually balanced and functional. Scale can also be used to create a sense of hierarchy within a design, with larger elements representing more important or dominant features.

Symmetry is the principle of creating balance and harmony through the use of mirrored or repeated elements. This can be seen in the design of many traditional buildings, where the left and right sides are identical or nearly identical. Symmetry creates a sense of order and stability in a structure. Mathematically, symmetry can be expressed as a reflection or rotation of an element about a central axis.

Balance is the final principle of traditional design. It refers to the distribution of visual weight within a structure. A well-balanced design will have elements that are evenly distributed and create a sense of equilibrium. This can be achieved through the use of symmetry, but also through the careful placement and sizing of elements. Balance is crucial in creating a visually appealing and functional structure.

### Subsection 1.1c Traditional vs. Modern Design

While traditional design principles have been the foundation of architectural practice for centuries, modern design has emerged as a new approach to creating structures. Modern design often breaks away from traditional principles and embraces new materials, technologies, and aesthetics. However, this does not mean that traditional design principles are no longer relevant. In fact, many modern designs still incorporate traditional elements and principles, showing the enduring influence of traditional design in the field of architecture.

One key difference between traditional and modern design is the use of technology. Traditional design relied on manual drafting and physical models, while modern design utilizes computer-aided design (CAD) and other digital tools. This has allowed for more complex and innovative designs, but has also led to a shift away from the hands-on approach of traditional design.

Another difference is the use of materials. Traditional design often utilized locally sourced and natural materials, while modern design has embraced new materials such as steel, glass, and concrete. This has allowed for larger and more complex structures, but has also raised concerns about sustainability and environmental impact.

Despite these differences, both traditional and modern design share a common goal: to create functional and visually appealing structures. While traditional design principles may continue to evolve and adapt to new technologies and materials, they will always remain an important foundation for architectural practice. In the following sections, we will explore the traditional design values that have shaped the field of architecture.

This ensures that the structure is visually balanced and functional. Scale can also be used to create a sense of hierarchy within a design, with larger elements representing more important or dominant features.

Symmetry is the principle of creating balance and harmony through the use of mirrored or repeated elements. This can be seen in the Taj Mahal, where the structure is perfectly symmetrical on all sides. Symmetry can also be used to create a sense of order and stability in a design.

Balance is the final principle of traditional design and refers to the distribution of visual weight within a structure. A well-balanced design will have elements that are evenly distributed and create a sense of equilibrium. This can be achieved through the use of symmetry, proportion, and scale.

### Subsection 1.2: Design Process

The design process is a crucial aspect of traditional design, as it guides the architect from conceptualization to the final product. It involves a series of steps that help to transform an idea into a tangible structure.

#### Subsection 1.2a: Conceptualization

Conceptualization is the first step in the design process and involves the generation of ideas and concepts for a structure. This can be done through brainstorming, sketching, or using computer-aided design (CAD) software. The goal of conceptualization is to explore different possibilities and come up with a solid foundation for the design.

Once a concept has been established, the next step is to create a conceptualization. This is a higher level abstraction that facilitates the discussion and comparison of different ontologies, or ways of organizing and categorizing information. A conceptualization allows for knowledge sharing and reuse, as different ontologies based on the same conceptualization can be compared and understood.

However, the issue of how to describe a conceptualization in terms that can encompass multiple ontologies, known as the "Tower of Babel" problem, remains a challenge. This can be approached in a "bottom-up" or "top-down" manner, or a combination of both.

In more artificial situations, such as information systems, the idea of a conceptualization and its ontological commitment can be realized. This involves the formation of a conceptualization and its ontologies, which can be achieved through the following steps:

1. Defining the scope and purpose of the conceptualization
2. Identifying the key elements and relationships within the conceptualization
3. Mapping the conceptualization into specific ontologies
4. Implementing the ontologies in a formal language, such as pseudocode or mathematics

An example of this process can be seen in the creation of computer programs, where a conceptualization is expressed in pseudocode and then implemented in different programming languages. This allows for easier understanding and comparison of different implementations.

In conclusion, conceptualization is a crucial step in the design process, as it provides a solid foundation for the creation of a structure. It allows for the exploration of different ideas and the development of a conceptualization that can be realized through the use of ontologies and formal languages.

Balance is the final principle of traditional design and refers to the distribution of visual weight within a structure. It is achieved through the careful placement of elements and can be either symmetrical or asymmetrical. In traditional design, balance is often achieved through the use of symmetry, but asymmetrical balance can also be used to create a sense of movement and dynamism in a design.

### Subsection 1.2 Design Process:

The design process is a crucial aspect of traditional design, as it guides the architect from initial concept to final construction. It is a cyclical process that involves multiple stages, each building upon the previous one. These stages include programming, schematic design, design development, construction documents, and construction administration.

#### Subsection 1.2b Design Development

Design development is the stage in the design process where the architect refines the initial concept and begins to develop it into a more detailed and comprehensive design. This stage involves further research, analysis, and collaboration with the client and other stakeholders to ensure that the design meets all functional and aesthetic requirements.

During this stage, the architect will also begin to incorporate technical considerations, such as building codes, structural systems, and material selection, into the design. This is where the use of computational tools and software can greatly aid in the design process, allowing for more efficient and accurate development of the design.

The end result of the design development stage is a more refined and detailed design that is ready to move into the next stage of the process, construction documents. This stage is crucial in ensuring that the final construction of the project is successful and meets all necessary requirements.

In the next section, we will explore the use of computational tools and processes in traditional design, and how they have revolutionized the field of architecture.


## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design:

Traditional design has been the cornerstone of architectural practice for centuries, providing a solid foundation for creating aesthetically pleasing and functional structures. In this chapter, we will explore the principles, processes, and applications of traditional design, and how they have evolved over time.

### Section 1.1 Traditional Design Principles:

Traditional design principles have stood the test of time and continue to be relevant in modern architectural design. These principles, including proportion, scale, symmetry, and balance, provide a framework for creating harmonious and visually appealing structures.

#### Subsection 1.1b: Principles and Elements

In traditional design, there are several key principles that guide the creation of a structure. These principles include proportion, scale, symmetry, and balance. Each of these principles plays a crucial role in the overall design and must be carefully considered by the architect.

Proportion refers to the relationship between different elements within a design. It is the key to creating a harmonious and visually appealing structure. The use of proportion can be seen in the Parthenon, where the columns are carefully spaced and sized to create a sense of balance and harmony. Mathematically, proportion can be expressed as the ratio of one element to another, such as the ratio of the height of a column to its diameter.

Scale is another important principle in traditional design. It refers to the size of elements in relation to the overall structure. For example, in a building, the size of the windows and doors must be carefully considered in relation to the size of the walls and roof. This ensures that the structure is visually balanced and functional. Scale can also be used to create a sense of hierarchy within a design, with larger elements representing more important or dominant features.

Symmetry is the principle of creating balance and harmony through the use of mirrored or evenly distributed elements. This can be seen in the Taj Mahal, where the structure is perfectly symmetrical on all sides. Symmetry can also be used to create a sense of order and stability in a design.

Balance is the final principle of traditional design and refers to the distribution of visual weight in a structure. A well-balanced design will have a sense of equilibrium and stability, with no one element overpowering the others. This can be achieved through the careful use of proportion, scale, and symmetry.

### Subsection 1.2 Design Process:

The design process is a crucial aspect of traditional design, as it allows architects to translate their ideas into tangible structures. This process involves several stages, including conceptualization, schematic design, design development, and final design.

#### Subsection 1.2c: Final Design

The final design stage is the culmination of the design process, where all the ideas and concepts are refined and translated into a detailed plan for construction. This stage involves creating detailed drawings and specifications that will guide the construction of the structure.

In traditional design, the final design stage also involves incorporating feedback and input from clients, engineers, and other stakeholders. This collaborative approach ensures that the final design meets the needs and requirements of all parties involved.

The use of technology, specifically computer-aided design (CAD) programs, has greatly enhanced the final design stage in traditional design. These programs allow for more precise and efficient creation of detailed drawings and specifications, reducing the likelihood of errors and increasing the speed of the design process.

In conclusion, the final design stage is a crucial part of the traditional design process, where all the elements of proportion, scale, symmetry, and balance come together to create a harmonious and functional structure. With the advancements in technology, the final design stage has become more efficient and collaborative, allowing for the creation of even more impressive architectural works.

Sargent Wood Products is a leading company in the architectural construction and computation industry. Their innovative approach to construction, which combines traditional methods with advanced computational techniques, has revolutionized the field. In this section, we will take a tour of their factory to gain a better understanding of their processes and applications.

### Subsection: 7.1b Manufacturing Processes

During our tour of Sargent Wood Products, we were able to witness the various manufacturing processes that are used to create their high-quality wood products. These processes are a combination of traditional woodworking techniques and advanced computational methods, resulting in efficient and precise production.

The first step in the manufacturing process is the selection of raw materials. Sargent Wood Products sources their wood from sustainable forests, ensuring that their products are environmentally friendly. The wood is then cut into various sizes and shapes using traditional sawing techniques.

Next, the wood is sent through a series of machines for shaping and finishing. These machines are equipped with advanced computer systems that allow for precise and efficient operation. The outer and inner bearing casings, for example, are sent for raceway grinding, superfinishing, and final assembly using these machines.

One of the most impressive machines in the factory is the D-Shape printer. This 3-D printer uses a layering technique to create intricate and complex designs. The process begins with a 3-D model of the object to be printed, which is created using CAD software. The CAD file is then sent to the printer head, which breaks the model into 2-D slices. The printer head then deposits a layer of sand mixed with solid magnesium oxide (MgO) and an inorganic binding liquid made of magnesium chloride. This mixture chemically reacts to form a sandstone material, which takes about 24 hours to solidify. The result is a strong and durable product that resembles Sorel cement in composition.

To ensure that the sand is uniformly exposed to the binder, an electric piston on the beam that holds the printer head forces the head to shift in the direction perpendicular to the printer's direction of motion. This process is repeated four times to finish printing a layer. The stepper motors on the vertical beams then move the base upwards, and new sand is distributed into the frame to create the next layer.

After the manufacturing process is complete, the wood products are sent to the finishing department. Here, the products are sanded, stained, and sealed to give them a smooth and polished finish. This is done using traditional woodworking techniques, as well as advanced tools and equipment.

In conclusion, Sargent Wood Products' manufacturing processes are a perfect blend of traditional methods and advanced technology. This allows them to produce high-quality wood products efficiently and precisely, making them a leader in the architectural construction and computation industry.

# Hardware register

## Standards

SPIRIT IP-XACT and DITA SIDSC XML define standard XML formats for memory-mapped registers # Apollo command and service module

### Specifications

Sources:
 # WDC 65C02

## 65SC02

The 65SC02 is a variant of the WDC 65C02 without bit instructions # World Wide Web Consortium

## Specification maturation

W3C develops technical specifications for HTML5, CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and other technologies. Sometimes, when a specification becomes too large, it is split into independent modules that can mature at their own pace. Subsequent editions of a module or specification are known as levels and are denoted by the first integer in the title (e.g. CSS3 = Level 3). Subsequent revisions on each level are denoted by an integer following a decimal point (for example, CSS2.1 = Revision 1).

The W3C standard formation process is defined within the W3C process document, outlining four maturity levels through which each new standard or recommendation must progress.

### Working draft (WD)

After enough content has been gathered from 'editor drafts' and discussion, it may be published as a working draft (WD) for review by the community. Commentary by virtually anyone is accepted, though no promises are made with regard to action on any particular element commented upon.

At this stage, the standard document may have significant differences from its final form. As such, anyone who implements WD standards should be ready to significantly modify their implementations as the standard matures.

### Candidate recommendation (CR)

A candidate recommendation is a version of a standard that is more mature than the WD. At this point, the group responsible for the standard is satisfied that the standard meets its goal. The purpose of the CR is to elicit aid from the development community as to how implementable the standard is.

The standard document may change fu

In the Pre-U, each Principal Subject is graded on a three-band, nine-grade scale:
The full Pre-U Diploma is graded on the aggregate of the three Principal Subjects, the Independent Research Project, and the Global Perspectives portfolio. The two together (GPR) can also be taken as a separate subject. The Independent Research Project and the Global Perspectives portfolio are each worth exactly half of a Principal Subject; thus, their aggregate forms the equivalent of another Principal Subject. The Pre-U Diploma is graded out of 96 overall; each Principal Subject is graded out of 24, and both Global Perspectives and the Independent Research Report are graded out of 12 each. Some schools will do a mix of A-levels and Pre-U Principal Subjects. With such a mix it is still possible to earn a Pre-U Diploma.

Peer feedback can provide a fresh and unbiased viewpoint, as well as identify areas for improvement that may have been overlooked.

Peer feedback can be gathered through group discussions or written evaluations. It is important to create a safe and constructive environment for this feedback, where students can openly share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgement. This feedback can then be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the project, as well as potential areas for improvement.

In addition to peer feedback, it is also important to gather feedback from external partners or clients. These stakeholders may have a different perspective on the project and can provide valuable insights. This feedback can be gathered through surveys or interviews, and should be specific and targeted to elicit useful information.

By involving both peers and external stakeholders in the reflection process, a more comprehensive understanding of the project can be achieved. This allows for a more thorough evaluation of the project outcomes and can provide valuable lessons learned for future projects.

In conclusion, peer feedback and gathering feedback from external stakeholders are important steps in reflecting on the design and construction process. By incorporating these practices into the reflection process, students can gain a deeper understanding of their project and make improvements for future projects.
