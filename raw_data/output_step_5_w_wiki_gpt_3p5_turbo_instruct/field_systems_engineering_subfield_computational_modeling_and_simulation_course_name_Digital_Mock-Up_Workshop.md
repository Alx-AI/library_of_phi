### Section: - Section: 1.2 Tall Building Design:

### Subsection (optional): 1.2a Design Considerations for Tall Buildings

Tall buildings, also known as skyscrapers, have become a defining feature of modern cities. With the advancement of digital fabrication and design technologies, the construction of tall buildings has become more feasible and efficient. However, designing and constructing tall buildings comes with its own set of challenges and considerations.

One of the main challenges in tall building design is managing lateral movements caused by wind loads. As buildings increase in height, they become more susceptible to wind forces, which can cause discomfort for occupants and structural damage. To address this issue, various engineering techniques have been developed. One approach is to use an open mechanical floor in the middle of the building to allow wind to flow through, reducing wind loads and resulting movements by 10%-15%. This technique has been successfully implemented in buildings such as 432 Park Avenue, which has a 15:1 height-to-width ratio and multiple open-air mechanical floors.

Another approach to managing wind loads is to stiffen the structure. This can be achieved by using outrigger walls to connect the building core to the perimeter columns on two sides, distributing the loads and reducing lateral movements. The structure of 111 West 57th Street, for example, uses shear walls on the east and west facades to stiffen the structure while maintaining unobstructed views on the north and south sides.

In addition to wind loads, tall buildings also face challenges in terms of structural materials. With the use of higher-strength materials such as concrete with strengths of 18,000-20,000 psi and reinforcing steel with strengths of 100 ksi, the thickness of concrete walls can be reduced, allowing for more slender building designs. This is a critical factor in enabling the construction of super-slender buildings, which have a height-to-width ratio of 10:1 or higher.

However, the use of higher-strength materials also presents challenges in terms of engineering and construction. Specialized techniques and equipment are required to handle these materials, and careful consideration must be given to ensure the structural integrity and safety of the building.

In conclusion, designing tall buildings requires a comprehensive understanding of engineering principles and considerations. With the use of digital fabrication and design technologies, these challenges can be addressed and overcome, allowing for the construction of innovative and iconic structures that shape the skylines of our cities.

One of the main considerations in tall building design is the structural system. The structural system of a building is responsible for supporting the weight of the building and transferring loads to the foundation. In tall buildings, the structural system must also be able to withstand lateral forces caused by wind and seismic activity.

There are several types of structural systems commonly used in tall buildings, each with its own advantages and limitations. One of the most common systems is the steel frame system, which consists of a steel skeleton of columns and beams. This system is popular due to its strength, flexibility, and speed of construction. However, it is also more expensive than other systems and requires skilled labor for installation.

Another commonly used system is the reinforced concrete frame system, which uses concrete columns and beams to support the building. This system is more cost-effective than steel frame systems and can be used for both high-rise and low-rise buildings. However, it is not as flexible as steel and may require longer construction times.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using composite systems, which combine the advantages of both steel and concrete. These systems typically use steel beams and concrete slabs to create a strong and efficient structure. They are also more sustainable, as they use less material and produce less waste during construction.

In addition to these traditional systems, there has been a rise in the use of digital fabrication techniques to create innovative structural systems. One example is the use of 3D printing to create concrete structures, which allows for more complex and efficient designs. Another example is the use of parametric design to optimize the structural system based on specific site conditions and constraints.

Overall, the choice of structural system for a tall building depends on various factors such as cost, construction time, site conditions, and design goals. With the advancement of digital fabrication and design technologies, there are now more options available for creating efficient and sustainable structural systems for tall buildings.

The use of digital fabrication techniques, such as 3D printing and laser cutting, allowed for precise and efficient production of the tower's modules. This also enabled the designers to create intricate and complex designs that would not have been possible with traditional fabrication methods.

Overall, the Friction Joined Responsive Tower showcases the potential of combining digital fabrication and responsive design principles to create innovative and adaptable structures. In the following sections, we will dive deeper into the design and fabrication process of this project. 


## Chapter 10: Midterm Project

### Section 10.1: Friction Joined Responsive Tower - Daniel Cardoso, Dennis Michaud, and Vincent LeClerc

#### Subsection 10.1b: Fabrication Process and Techniques

In this section, we will discuss the fabrication process and techniques used in creating the Friction Joined Responsive Tower. As mentioned in the previous section, the tower was created using digital fabrication techniques, specifically 3D printing and laser cutting.

The first step in the fabrication process was to create a 3D model of the tower using CAD software. This allowed the designers to visualize and refine their design before moving on to the actual fabrication process. Once the model was finalized, it was sent to the printer head to begin the printing process.

The printer head used a layering technique, where a layer of sand mixed with solid magnesium oxide (MgO) was evenly distributed in the area enclosed by the frame. The printer head then broke the 3D model into 2D slices and deposited an inorganic binding liquid made up of a solution that included magnesium chloride. This binder reacted with the sand to form a sandstone material, which took approximately 24 hours to solidify.

To ensure the sand was uniformly exposed to the binder, an electric piston on the beam holding the printer head forced it to shift in a direction perpendicular to its motion. This process was repeated four times to finish printing a layer. After each layer was completed, the stepper motors on the vertical beams moved the base upwards, and new sand was distributed into the frame to create the next layer.

Once the printing process was complete, excess sand was removed using shovels to reveal the final structure. The use of sand as a support for the solidifying material allowed for its reuse in later printings, making the process more sustainable.

In addition to 3D printing, laser cutting was also used in the fabrication process. This technique was used to create intricate and complex designs on the tower's modules, which would not have been possible with traditional fabrication methods.

Overall, the combination of 3D printing and laser cutting allowed for precise and efficient production of the Friction Joined Responsive Tower. The use of digital fabrication techniques also enabled the designers to create a unique and adaptable structure that would not have been possible with traditional methods.

### Section 10.3: Algorithms and Design Descriptions for Relational Modeling - Taro Narahara and Kenfield Griffith

#### Subsection 10.3a: Introduction to Relational Modeling

In this subsection, we will introduce the concept of relational modeling and its application in digital fabrication and design. Relational modeling is a theory that uses algebraic structures to model data and define queries on it with a well-founded semantics. It was first introduced by Edgar F. Codd in the field of database theory, and has since been widely used in the development of relational databases and query languages such as SQL.

The main purpose of relational modeling is to define operators that transform one or more input relations into an output relation. These operators can be combined to express complex queries that transform multiple input relations into a single output relation. This makes relational modeling a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis.

One of the key advantages of relational modeling is its ability to handle implicit data structures. These are data structures that are not explicitly defined, but can be inferred from the data itself. This allows for more efficient and flexible data storage and retrieval.

To better understand the concept of relational modeling, let's consider an example of a soft skin façade for a tall building. The façade is made up of a series of interconnected panels that open and close in response to external conditions, similar to the skin of a snake. In this case, the input relations would be the external conditions, such as temperature and sunlight, and the output relation would be the position of the panels. By using relational modeling, we can define operators that transform the input relations into the desired output relation, allowing for a dynamic and responsive façade.

In addition to its application in digital fabrication and design, relational modeling has also been used in other fields such as computer science and mathematics. It has been instrumental in the development of relational databases and has greatly influenced the way data is stored and queried in modern technology.

In the next subsection, we will explore the different operators used in relational modeling and their applications in digital fabrication and design. 


## Chapter 10: Midterm Project

### Section 10.3: Algorithms and Design Descriptions for Relational Modeling - Taro Narahara and Kenfield Griffith

#### Subsection 10.3b: Algorithmic Design Techniques

In this subsection, we will explore some algorithmic design techniques that can be used in conjunction with relational modeling to solve complex problems in digital fabrication and design. These techniques involve breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems and using algorithms to solve them.

One such technique is the use of divide and conquer algorithms. This involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them recursively, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem. This approach is particularly useful for problems that can be divided into similar subproblems, such as the design of a complex structure made up of repeated elements.

Another technique is dynamic programming, which involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems in a table. This allows for more efficient computation of the solutions to larger subproblems, as they can be retrieved from the table rather than being recalculated. This technique is often used in optimization problems, such as finding the most efficient layout for a set of components.

In addition to these techniques, there are also various algorithms that can be used for specific types of problems. For example, the A* algorithm is commonly used for pathfinding and can be applied to the design of efficient toolpaths for CNC machines. The Remez algorithm is useful for approximating functions and can be used in the design of smooth curves for 3D printing.

It is important to note that the choice of algorithm and design technique will depend on the specific problem at hand. Some problems may require a combination of techniques, while others may have a more straightforward solution. It is also important to consider the limitations and assumptions of each algorithm, as they may not always be applicable to every problem.

In conclusion, the use of algorithmic design techniques in conjunction with relational modeling can greatly enhance the capabilities of digital fabrication and design. By breaking down complex problems and using efficient algorithms, we can create more sophisticated and responsive designs. As technology continues to advance, it is important for designers to stay informed and utilize these techniques to push the boundaries of what is possible in the digital realm.

One of the main applications of relational modeling in architecture is in the creation of building information models (BIM). BIM is a digital representation of a building that contains all of its physical and functional characteristics. It allows for the integration of various data sources and enables collaboration among different stakeholders in the design and construction process. Relational modeling is used to create the underlying data structure for BIM, allowing for the efficient storage and retrieval of information.

Another application of relational modeling in architecture is in the design of complex structures. As mentioned in the previous subsection, algorithmic design techniques can be used in conjunction with relational modeling to solve complex problems. This is particularly useful in the design of structures that require repetitive elements, such as facades or structural systems. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using algorithms to solve them, architects can create efficient and innovative designs.

Relational modeling also plays a crucial role in the analysis and optimization of architectural designs. By creating a data model that accurately represents the building, architects can use various algorithms and techniques to analyze different aspects of the design, such as structural stability, energy efficiency, and cost optimization. This allows for a more informed decision-making process and can lead to more sustainable and cost-effective designs.

In addition to these applications, relational modeling can also be used in the visualization of architectural designs. By creating a data model that contains all of the necessary information, architects can generate visual representations of the building, such as renderings and animations. This allows for a better understanding of the design and can aid in communication with clients and stakeholders.

Overall, relational modeling is a valuable tool in the field of architecture, enabling architects to create more efficient, innovative, and sustainable designs. By utilizing algorithmic design techniques and data analysis, architects can push the boundaries of traditional design and create structures that are both functional and visually appealing.

#### 12.1b The Process of 3D Printing

The process of 3D printing begins with the creation of a 3D model on computer-aided design (CAD) software. This model is then sent to the 3D printer, which breaks it down into 2D slices. The printer then deposits a layer of sand mixed with solid magnesium oxide (MgO) in the area enclosed by the frame. The printer head then moves across the base, depositing an inorganic binding liquid made up of a solution that includes magnesium chloride. This binder reacts with the sand to form a sandstone material, which takes about 24 hours to solidify.

To ensure the sand is uniformly exposed to the binder, an electric piston on the beam that holds the printer head forces it to shift in a direction perpendicular to the printer's motion. This process is repeated four times to finish printing a layer. The base is then moved upwards by stepper motors on the vertical beams, and new sand is distributed into the frame to create the next layer. Excess sand is used as a support for the solidifying sand and can be reused in future printings.

Once the printing process is complete, the final structure must be extruded from the sand. Workers use shovels to remove the excess sand and reveal the final product. The sand used in this process is similar in composition to Sorel cement, making it a durable and sturdy material for architectural applications.

#### 15.3c Case Studies in Plumbing Systems

In this section, we will explore some case studies of plumbing systems in architecture to better understand their applications and impact on building design and functionality.

##### Case Study 1: Sustainable Water Supply System in Urban Area

In urban areas, the water supply system is typically provided by a municipal water system. However, with the increasing focus on sustainability, some cities have implemented innovative solutions to reduce water usage and promote conservation.

One example is the city of San Francisco, which has implemented a greywater recycling system in some buildings. Greywater is wastewater from sources such as sinks, showers, and laundry, which can be treated and reused for non-potable purposes like irrigation and toilet flushing. This reduces the strain on the municipal water supply and promotes sustainable water usage.

Another example is the city of Melbourne, Australia, which has implemented a dual water supply system in some buildings. This system separates the potable water supply from non-potable water supply, with the non-potable water being used for purposes such as toilet flushing and irrigation. This reduces the strain on the potable water supply and promotes conservation.

## Scope

<refimprove section|date=October 2016>
The purpose of building codes is to provide minimum standards for safety, health, and general welfare including structural integrity, mechanical integrity (including sanitation, water supply, light, and ventilation), means of egress, fire prevention and control, and energy conservation.
Building codes generally include:

- Structural requirements for buildings and structures
- Mechanical requirements for plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems
- Sanitation requirements for water supply and waste disposal
- Means of egress requirements for safe evacuation in case of emergency
- Fire prevention and control requirements
- Energy conservation requirements

Building codes are generally separate from zoning ordinances, but exterior restrictions (such as setbacks) may fall into either category.

Designers use building code standards out of substantial reference books during design. Building departments review plans submitted to them before construction, issue permits [or not] and inspectors verify compliance to these standards at the site during construction.

There are often additional codes or sections of the same building code that have more specific requirements that apply to dwellings or places of business and special construction objects such as canopies, signs, pedestrian walkways, parking lots, and radio and television antennas.

# Digital Mock-Up Workshop: A Comprehensive Guide to Digital Fabrication and Design:

## Chapter 16: Building Codes and Regulations:

### Section: 16.1 Building Codes in Architecture:

### Subsection (optional): 16.1c Case Studies in Building Codes

Building codes are an essential aspect of the digital mock-up workshop process. They provide minimum standards for safety, health, and general welfare, as well as regulations for energy conservation. However, despite their importance, there have been instances where the actual energy use of a building does not align with the expected energy use calculated using building codes. This is known as the "performance gap" and can be attributed to various factors, including workmanship.

In the work of Pettersen, uncertainties in group 2 (workmanship and quality of elements) and group 3 (behavior) were considered. This study showed that the total energy use of a building follows a normal distribution, with a standard deviation of around 7.6% when uncertainties due to occupants are considered, and 4.0% when considering uncertainties generated by building elements. This highlights the importance of considering workmanship in the digital mock-up workshop process.

A significant case study in building codes and workmanship was carried out by Leeds Metropolitan at Stamford Brook. This project involved the construction of 700 dwellings built to high efficiency standards. However, the results showed a significant gap between the expected energy use before construction and the actual energy use once the houses were occupied. This was attributed to workmanship, specifically thermal bridges that were not considered in the calculations. The study also emphasized the impact of internal partitions on energy use, with one dwelling showing a +176% difference between the real energy use and the expected value calculated using building codes.

Hopfe's work also highlights the importance of considering uncertainties in building design, particularly in workmanship. In a recent publication, uncertainties in group 2 and 3 were defined as normal distributions. The study generated 200 tests and analyzed the results to determine the uncertainties with the largest impact on energy calculations. The study found that the uncertainty in infiltration values had the most significant influence on cooling and heating demand.

These case studies demonstrate the importance of considering workmanship in the digital mock-up workshop process. Building codes provide minimum standards for safety and energy conservation, but they must be implemented correctly to achieve the desired results. Architects and designers must pay close attention to workmanship and ensure that it aligns with building codes to bridge the performance gap and create more sustainable and efficient buildings.


# Digital Mock-Up Workshop: A Comprehensive Guide to Digital Fabrication and Design:

## Chapter 16: Building Codes and Regulations:

### Section: 16.2 Zoning Regulations in Architecture:

### Subsection (optional): 16.2a Introduction to Zoning Regulations

Zoning regulations play a crucial role in the development and design of buildings. They are a set of laws and regulations that dictate how land can be used and developed within a specific area. These regulations are put in place to ensure the safety, health, and general welfare of the community, as well as to promote efficient land use and development.

Zoning regulations are typically implemented at the local level by city or county governments. They divide a city or county into different zones, each with its own set of permitted land uses and development standards. These zones can include residential, commercial, industrial, and mixed-use areas. The purpose of these zones is to separate incompatible land uses and to create a cohesive and functional community.

One of the main goals of zoning regulations is to promote smart growth and sustainable development. This is achieved through various tools and techniques, such as urban growth boundaries, transfer of development rights, and density incentives. These tools aim to limit urban sprawl, preserve open space and farmland, and encourage infill development.

Urban growth boundaries (UGBs) are a popular tool used in some cities to contain high-density development within a specific area. This helps to prevent urban sprawl and encourages development in already established areas. However, UGBs have also been criticized for contributing to the escalation of housing prices, as they limit the supply of developable land.

Transfer of development rights (TDR) is another tool used to promote smart growth. It allows property owners in desirable areas to purchase the right to build at higher densities from owners of properties in less desirable areas. This helps to preserve open space and farmland while promoting development in areas that are already developed.

In addition to promoting smart growth, zoning regulations also play a crucial role in ensuring building safety and energy efficiency. Building codes, which are a part of zoning regulations, set minimum standards for safety, health, and energy conservation. However, there have been instances where the actual energy use of a building does not align with the expected energy use calculated using building codes. This is known as the "performance gap" and can be attributed to various factors, including workmanship.

To address this issue, it is important to consider uncertainties in building design, particularly in regards to workmanship and the behavior of occupants. Studies have shown that the total energy use of a building follows a normal distribution, with a standard deviation of around 7.6% when uncertainties due to occupants are considered, and 4.0% when considering uncertainties generated by building elements. This highlights the importance of considering workmanship in the digital mock-up workshop process.

One significant case study in building codes and workmanship was carried out by Leeds Metropolitan at Stamford Brook. This project involved the construction of 700 dwellings built to high efficiency standards. However, the results showed a significant gap between the expected energy use before construction and the actual energy use once the houses were occupied. This was attributed to workmanship, specifically thermal bridges that were not considered in the calculations. The study also emphasized the impact of internal partitions on energy use, with one dwelling showing a +176% difference between the real energy use and the expected value calculated using building codes.

In conclusion, zoning regulations are a crucial aspect of the digital mock-up workshop process. They not only promote smart growth and sustainable development but also ensure building safety and energy efficiency. It is important for architects and designers to understand and comply with these regulations to create functional, safe, and energy-efficient buildings.

### Section: 16.2 Zoning Regulations in Architecture:

### Subsection (optional): 16.2b Applications of Zoning Regulations in Architecture

Zoning regulations have a significant impact on the design and development of buildings. They not only dictate the types of land uses and development standards for a particular area, but they also influence the overall character and functionality of a community. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of zoning regulations in architecture.

#### Designating Land Use Zones

One of the primary functions of zoning regulations is to designate different land use zones within a city or county. These zones can include residential, commercial, industrial, and mixed-use areas. Each zone has its own set of permitted land uses and development standards, which are intended to promote a cohesive and functional community.

For example, residential zones typically allow for single-family homes, townhouses, and apartments, while commercial zones may permit retail stores, restaurants, and offices. Industrial zones, on the other hand, may allow for manufacturing facilities and warehouses. Mixed-use zones, as the name suggests, allow for a combination of different land uses, such as residential and commercial.

By designating these zones, zoning regulations help to prevent incompatible land uses from coexisting in the same area. This can help to reduce noise, traffic, and other potential conflicts between different land uses.

#### Promoting Smart Growth and Sustainable Development

Zoning regulations also play a crucial role in promoting smart growth and sustainable development. This is achieved through various tools and techniques, such as urban growth boundaries, transfer of development rights, and density incentives.

Urban growth boundaries (UGBs) are a popular tool used in some cities to contain high-density development within a specific area. This helps to prevent urban sprawl and encourages development in already established areas. However, UGBs have also been criticized for contributing to the escalation of housing prices, as they limit the supply of developable land.

Transfer of development rights (TDR) is another tool used to promote smart growth. It allows property owners in desirable areas to purchase the right to build at higher densities from owners of properties in less desirable areas. This helps to preserve open space and farmland, while also encouraging development in areas that are already developed.

#### Controlling Building Form and Design

In addition to regulating land use, zoning regulations also control the physical form and design of buildings. This is achieved through building form standards, which are sets of enforceable design regulations for controlling building types and their impact on the public realm.

Building form standards can control various aspects of building design, such as the alignment of buildings to the street, the visibility and accessibility of building entrances, and the minimum and maximum building heights. These regulations are less concerned with architectural styles and designs and more focused on how buildings shape public spaces.

#### Ensuring Safety and Health

Another critical application of zoning regulations in architecture is to ensure the safety and health of the community. Zoning regulations often include requirements for building setbacks, fire safety, and access to natural light and ventilation. These regulations help to create safe and healthy living and working environments for residents and workers.

#### Preserving Historic and Cultural Resources

Zoning regulations can also be used to preserve historic and cultural resources within a community. This is achieved through architectural standards, which are drafted in addition to building form standards. Architectural standards may include requirements for preserving the historic appearance of a neighborhood, such as the use of specific building materials or architectural styles.

In conclusion, zoning regulations have a significant impact on the design and development of buildings. They not only regulate land use but also promote smart growth, control building form and design, ensure safety and health, and preserve historic and cultural resources. As architects, it is essential to understand and comply with these regulations to create functional, sustainable, and safe built environments.

### Section: 16.2 Zoning Regulations in Architecture:

### Subsection (optional): 16.2c Case Studies in Zoning Regulations

Zoning regulations are a crucial aspect of urban planning and development, as they dictate the types of land uses and development standards for a particular area. In this section, we will explore some case studies of how zoning regulations have been applied in different cities and their impact on the built environment.

#### Case Study 1: Portland, Oregon's Urban Growth Boundary

One of the most well-known examples of zoning regulations in the United States is Portland, Oregon's urban growth boundary (UGB). Established in the 1970s, the UGB is a tool used to contain high density development to certain areas and prevent urban sprawl. This has helped to preserve farmland and natural areas outside of the boundary, while promoting denser development within the city.

The UGB has been credited with promoting smart growth and sustainable development in Portland. By limiting the supply of developable land, it has encouraged infill development and the use of brownfield sites, reducing the need for new infrastructure and preserving open space. However, some critics argue that the UGB has contributed to the escalation of housing prices in the city.

#### Case Study 2: New York City's Transfer of Development Rights Program

New York City's Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) program is a prime example of how zoning regulations can be used to promote sustainable development and preserve historic buildings. The program allows developers to purchase the right to build at higher densities from owners of properties in designated historic districts, in exchange for preserving the historic buildings.

This has helped to protect the city's historic character while also promoting denser development in designated areas. The TDR program has been successful in preserving over 200 historic buildings in New York City.

#### Case Study 3: San Francisco's Density Bonus Program

San Francisco's Density Bonus Program is an example of how zoning regulations can be used to incentivize developers to include affordable housing in their projects. The program allows developers to build at higher densities in exchange for including a certain percentage of affordable housing units in their projects.

This has helped to address the city's affordable housing crisis and promote more diverse and inclusive communities. However, some critics argue that the program has not been effective in providing enough affordable housing and has led to gentrification in some neighborhoods.

In conclusion, these case studies demonstrate the diverse applications and impacts of zoning regulations in different cities. While they can be effective in promoting smart growth and sustainable development, they also have their limitations and challenges. It is important for urban planners and policymakers to carefully consider the specific needs and context of their city when implementing zoning regulations.

### Section: 16.3 Accessibility Standards in Architecture:

### Subsection (optional): 16.3a Introduction to Accessibility Standards

In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on accessibility in architecture and design. This is due to the increasing recognition of the importance of creating inclusive spaces that can be used by people of all abilities. In this section, we will explore the various accessibility standards that have been developed and implemented in architecture.

#### The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

One of the most well-known accessibility standards is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), WCAG provides a set of guidelines and success criteria for creating accessible web content. The guidelines are organized into four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Each principle has testable success criteria that must be met in order to achieve compliance.

WCAG has gone through several versions, with the current version being WCAG 2.1. This version is backwards-compatible with WCAG 2.0 and includes 17 additional success criteria. WCAG is widely used and referenced in the development of accessible websites.

#### PAS 78

Another important accessibility standard is PAS 78, which stands for "Publicly Available Specification 78." Developed by the Disability Rights Commission in the UK, PAS 78 provides best practice guidelines for commissioning accessible websites. It was created in response to the findings that the majority of UK websites were not meeting basic levels of accessibility.

PAS 78 is particularly relevant for businesses in the UK, as it helps to clarify their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act. It provides guidance on how to make websites accessible for people with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, physical, and cognitive impairments.

#### The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities. This includes discrimination in the built environment, such as in buildings and public spaces. The ADA has specific accessibility requirements for new construction and alterations, including accessible routes, entrances, and restrooms.

The ADA also has specific guidelines for accessible design in different types of buildings, such as schools, healthcare facilities, and commercial buildings. These guidelines are constantly evolving and are enforced by the Department of Justice.

#### Universal Design

While accessibility standards provide important guidelines for creating inclusive spaces, there is also a growing movement towards universal design. Universal design is the design of products and environments that can be used by all people, regardless of their age, size, ability, or disability. It goes beyond minimum accessibility requirements and aims to create spaces that are usable and comfortable for everyone.

In architecture, universal design can be achieved through features such as wide doorways, level entrances, and adjustable countertops. By incorporating universal design principles, architects can create spaces that are not only accessible, but also more functional and comfortable for all users.

In conclusion, accessibility standards play a crucial role in promoting inclusive design in architecture. By following these standards and incorporating universal design principles, architects can create spaces that are accessible and welcoming for people of all abilities.

### Subsection (optional): 16.3b Applications of Accessibility Standards in Architecture

In the previous section, we discussed the various accessibility standards that have been developed and implemented in architecture. In this section, we will explore the practical applications of these standards in the design and construction of buildings.

#### Incorporating WCAG into Building Design

As mentioned earlier, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a set of guidelines and success criteria for creating accessible web content. However, these guidelines can also be applied to building design. For example, the principle of "perceivable" can be translated to the physical environment by ensuring that all important information is presented in multiple formats, such as through visual, auditory, and tactile means. This can include using braille signage, providing audio descriptions for visual elements, and using contrasting colors for those with visual impairments.

The principle of "operable" can be applied by designing buildings with features that are easy to use for people with disabilities. This can include installing automatic doors, providing ramps and elevators for wheelchair access, and designing door handles and light switches that can be easily operated by those with limited dexterity.

The principle of "understandable" can be incorporated by using clear and simple language in signage and instructions, as well as providing clear pathways and wayfinding systems throughout the building. This can be especially helpful for individuals with cognitive disabilities.

Lastly, the principle of "robust" can be applied by designing buildings that are durable and can withstand wear and tear, as well as incorporating features that can be easily maintained and repaired. This is important for ensuring that the building remains accessible for all individuals in the long term.

#### Implementing PAS 78 in Building Design

PAS 78, or the Publicly Available Specification 78, provides best practice guidelines for commissioning accessible websites. However, these guidelines can also be applied to building design. For example, PAS 78 recommends that websites provide alternative text for images, which can also be applied to building design by providing tactile models or audio descriptions for visual elements in the building.

PAS 78 also emphasizes the importance of user testing and feedback in the design process. This can be translated to building design by involving individuals with disabilities in the design process and seeking their feedback on the accessibility of the building.

#### Other Accessibility Standards in Building Design

In addition to WCAG and PAS 78, there are other accessibility standards that can be applied in building design. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States sets standards for accessibility in public buildings, including requirements for accessible entrances, restrooms, and parking spaces.

The International Building Code (IBC) also includes accessibility standards for buildings, such as requirements for accessible routes, door widths, and handrails. These codes and regulations vary by country and region, but they all aim to ensure that buildings are accessible for individuals with disabilities.

In conclusion, incorporating accessibility standards in building design is crucial for creating inclusive spaces that can be used by people of all abilities. By following these standards and guidelines, architects and designers can ensure that their buildings are accessible and welcoming for all individuals.

The museum also has ramps and elevators for wheelchair access, and door handles and light switches that can be easily operated by those with limited dexterity.

Another example is the Maggie's Centre in Manchester, UK. Designed by Foster + Partners, this cancer care center incorporates the principles of WCAG in its design. The building has clear and simple signage and wayfinding systems, as well as features that are easy to use for individuals with disabilities. The center also has a sensory garden, designed to provide a calming and therapeutic environment for individuals with cognitive disabilities.

#### Incorporating PAS 78 into Website Design

PAS 78, or the Publicly Available Specification 78, is a set of best practice guidelines for commissioning accessible websites. While it was originally developed for websites, the principles of PAS 78 can also be applied to building design.

One example is the Tate Modern Switch House in London, UK. Designed by Herzog & de Meuron, the building incorporates features that align with the principles of PAS 78. For example, the building has clear and simple signage and wayfinding systems, as well as features that are easy to use for individuals with disabilities. The building also has a tactile model of the building, designed to provide a tactile experience for individuals with visual impairments.

Another example is the Seattle Central Library in Seattle, USA. Designed by Rem Koolhaas, the library incorporates features such as braille signage, audio descriptions, and tactile maps to make it accessible to individuals with disabilities. The library also has a variety of seating options, including adjustable desks and chairs, to accommodate individuals with different physical needs.

#### Conclusion

These case studies demonstrate the successful implementation of accessibility standards in architecture. By incorporating principles from WCAG and PAS 78 into building design, architects and designers can create spaces that are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
