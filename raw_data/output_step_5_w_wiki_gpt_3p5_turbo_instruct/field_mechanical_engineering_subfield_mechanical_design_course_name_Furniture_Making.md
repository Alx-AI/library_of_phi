The living room is often the central gathering place in a home, where people relax, entertain, and spend time with family and friends. Therefore, the furniture should be comfortable, inviting, and able to accommodate multiple people.

One of the key considerations when designing living room furniture is the layout of the room. The furniture should be arranged in a way that promotes conversation and allows for easy movement throughout the space. This can be achieved by creating different seating areas or using modular furniture that can be rearranged as needed.

Another important aspect to consider is the style and aesthetic of the living room. The furniture should complement the existing decor and reflect the overall design theme of the room. This can be achieved through the use of materials, colors, and patterns that tie in with the rest of the space.

#### 6.1c Entertainment Centers

Entertainment centers are a popular addition to living rooms, as they provide a central location for storing and displaying electronics such as TVs, gaming consoles, and sound systems. When designing an entertainment center, it is important to consider the size and layout of the room, as well as the size and placement of the electronics it will hold.

One design consideration for entertainment centers is cable management.

Another design consideration is storage. Entertainment centers can also serve as storage space for DVDs, games, and other media. It is important to consider the amount of storage needed and incorporate shelves, drawers, or cabinets accordingly.

### Section: 6.1 Living Room Furniture:

When designing furniture for a living room, it is important to consider the overall style and aesthetic of the space. The living room is often the central gathering place in a home, and the furniture should reflect this by being comfortable, inviting, and functional.

One type of furniture commonly found in living rooms is bookshelves and cabinets. These pieces serve both a practical and decorative purpose, providing storage for books and other items while also adding visual interest to the room.

First, it is important to take accurate measurements of the space where the furniture will be placed. This includes not only the dimensions of the room, but also the location of windows, doors, and other architectural features. This will ensure that the furniture fits properly and does not obstruct any important elements of the room.

Next, consider the existing decor and style of the living room. Bookshelves and cabinets should complement the overall aesthetic of the space, whether it is modern, traditional, or eclectic. This can be achieved through the use of materials, colors, and design elements that are consistent with the rest of the room.

However, it is important to consider the size and weight of the objects being stored, as well as the potential for dust and other environmental factors. In these cases, it may be beneficial to use boxes or covers to protect the items.

Cabinets, on the other hand, offer more versatility and can be designed with adjustable shelves and drawers to accommodate a variety of items. They also provide the added benefit of being able to close off the items from dust and light, even if they are not individually covered.

When designing drawers, it is important to consider whether they will be open or closed, and whether they will be contained within a cabinet or stand alone. Open drawers allow for easy access to items, but may require additional measures to prevent objects from falling out. Closed drawers offer more protection for items, but may be more difficult to access.

In conclusion, when designing bookshelves and cabinets for a living room, it is important to consider the space, style, functionality, and design of the furniture.

### Section: 6.4 Office Furniture:

When it comes to designing furniture for an office space, it is important to consider the function of the space as well as the overall style and aesthetic. The office is a place for productivity and focus, so the furniture should be functional, comfortable, and conducive to work.

One type of furniture commonly found in offices is office chairs. These pieces of furniture serve as a seating option for individuals to complete tasks and work at their desks. When designing office chairs, there are several factors to consider.

First, it is important to take accurate measurements of the space where the chair will be placed. This includes not only the dimensions of the room, but also the location of other furniture and equipment such as desks and computers. This will ensure that the chair fits properly and allows for comfortable movement around the room.

Next, consider the existing decor and style of the office. The chair should complement the overall aesthetic of the space, whether it is modern, traditional, or somewhere in between. This can be achieved through the use of materials, colors, and design elements that are consistent with the rest of the room.

In terms of functionality, office chairs should be designed to provide comfort and support while also being visually appealing. This may include considering the size and shape of the chair, as well as any additional features such as lumbar support, adjustable armrests, and seat height. It is also important to consider the height of the chair in relation to the desk and other pieces in the room.

When it comes to the design of office chairs, there are several options to consider. Task chairs are the most basic and typically do not offer lumbar support or a headrest. These chairs are best suited for short periods of sitting and offer more room to move. Mid-back chairs offer fuller back support and can be sat in for longer periods of time with the right ergonomic design. High-end chairs in this category, such as the Herman Miller Aeron and the Steelcase Leap, are designed for extended use and offer customizable options. Executive or full-back chairs offer full back and head support and are typically the most expensive option. These chairs are designed for long periods of sitting and often have additional features such as adjustable headrests and armrests.

Coquina, a limestone conglomerate, was also used as a building stone in St. Augustine, Florida.

When designing for the colonial style, it is essential to pay attention to the details and use natural materials such as wood, stone, and leather. The color palette is typically warm and earthy, with accents of rich colors such as red, green, and blue. Furniture pieces should be functional and have a sense of simplicity, with ornate details kept to a minimum.

One of the main benefits of using reclaimed wood is that it reduces the demand for new timber, which helps to preserve forests and natural habitats. Additionally, using reclaimed wood also reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. This is because reclaimed wood is often sourced from structures that would have otherwise been demolished and discarded.

In the United States, reclaimed wood has a rich history. Before the widespread use of modern building materials, wood was the primary material used for construction due to its strength, affordability, and abundance. However, as the demand for wood increased, many of the once-plentiful species became scarce. This is where reclaimed wood comes in, as it provides a sustainable alternative to using new timber.

One of the most common types of reclaimed wood is longleaf pine, which was used to build factories and warehouses during the Industrial Revolution. These trees were slow-growing, taking 200 to 400 years to mature, and were abundant in thick forests that spanned over North America. Today, reclaimed longleaf pine is often sold as Heart Pine, with the word "heart" referring to the heartwood of the tree.

Other types of reclaimed wood include redwood on the U.S. west coast and American Chestnut on the U.S. east coast. These woods were once commonly used for building barns and other structures, but due to factors such as the chestnut blight that killed billions of American Chestnuts, they have become rare. Reclaimed wood from these structures is highly sought after for its unique and desirable characteristics.

When using reclaimed wood, it is important to consider its origins. For example, worm tracks in sawn timber can indicate whether the wood was felled before or after the chestnut blight. This information can add value to the wood and provide insight into its history.

However, the extraction and processing of these metals can have significant environmental impacts, such as air and water pollution, deforestation, and energy consumption.

Recycling metal not only reduces the need for new mining and extraction, but it also saves a significant amount of energy. For example, recycling aluminum saves 95% of the energy cost compared to processing new aluminum. This is because the temperature required to melt recycled aluminum is much lower than that needed for extracting it from its ore. Additionally, recycling one aluminum can save enough energy to power a television for three hours.

One of the most commonly recycled metals is aluminum. It is shredded and melted in an aluminum smelter, producing molten aluminum that is indistinguishable from virgin aluminum. This process can be repeated indefinitely without any change in the metal's quality. In fact, Americans throw away enough aluminum every year to rebuild their entire commercial air fleet.

Copper is another highly recyclable metal. It can be separated from other materials magnetically and recycled in a steelworks. Similarly, iron and steel are also easily recycled and can be used to produce top-quality new metal without any downgrading.

Other less common metals, such as titanium and nickel, can also be recycled. However, the recycling process for these metals may be more complex and require specialized facilities.

In conclusion, using recycled metal in furniture making is a sustainable choice that reduces the environmental impact of metal extraction and processing. It also conserves energy and reduces the need for new mining. However, it is important to ensure that the recycled metal is sourced from responsible and sustainable practices to avoid negative impacts on the environment.

- Drop cloth: Use a drop cloth to protect your work area from overspray.

Now that you have the necessary equipment, let's go through the steps for achieving a professional-looking finish using a spray gun.

1. Prepare the wood: Before starting the spray finishing process, make sure the wood surface is clean and free of any dust or debris. Sand the wood with fine-grit sandpaper to create a smooth surface for the finish to adhere to.

2. Dilute the finish: Depending on the type of finish you are using, you may need to dilute it with a solvent or water. This will help the finish flow more easily through the spray gun and create a smoother finish. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the correct ratio of finish to solvent.

3. Adjust the spray gun: Before starting to spray, adjust the spray gun to achieve the desired spray pattern and pressure. This will depend on the type of finish and the surface you are working on. It is recommended to practice on a scrap piece of wood before starting on your project.

4. Apply the finish: Hold the spray gun about 6-8 inches away from the wood surface and move it in a smooth, even motion. Start spraying off the wood and then move across the surface in a steady back-and-forth motion. Overlap each pass slightly to ensure even coverage. It is better to apply multiple thin coats rather than one thick coat to avoid drips and runs.

5. Allow the finish to dry: After applying the finish, allow it to dry completely before applying another coat. This will depend on the type of finish and the environmental conditions. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the recommended drying time.

6. Sand and repeat: Once the first coat is dry, lightly sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper to remove any imperfections. Then, apply another coat of finish following the same steps as before. Repeat this process until you achieve the desired finish.

7. Clean up: After you have finished spraying, clean the spray gun and equipment thoroughly with the appropriate solvent. This will prevent any clogs or damage to the equipment.

By following these steps and using the right equipment, you can achieve a professional-looking finish on your furniture pieces using spray finishing techniques. Remember to always wear protective gear and practice on a scrap piece of wood before starting on your project.

#### 17.3c Finishing and Detailing

The finishing and detailing of a wardrobe are what truly sets it apart as an advanced furniture project. This is where you can let your creativity shine and add unique touches to your design. Consider incorporating intricate carvings, inlays, or marquetry into the doors or drawers of your wardrobe. You can also experiment with different finishes, such as staining, painting, or using a natural oil finish to enhance the beauty of the wood.

In addition to aesthetics, it is also essential to pay attention to the functionality of your wardrobe. Consider adding features such as adjustable shelves, built-in lighting, or hidden compartments to make your wardrobe not only beautiful but also practical.

### Section: 17.3 Wardrobe

In this section, we will be discussing how to create a wardrobe, a staple piece of furniture in any bedroom or closet space. While a basic wardrobe may seem simple to make, an advanced wardrobe requires a combination of technical skills, creativity, and attention to detail.

#### 17.3a Design and Materials

Before starting any advanced furniture project, it is crucial to have a well-thought-out design and select the right materials. When it comes to designing a wardrobe, there are endless possibilities. You can choose to create a traditional, modern, or unique design, depending on your personal style and the overall aesthetic of the room.

When selecting materials for an advanced wardrobe, it is essential to consider both the appearance and functionality. Hardwoods such as oak, cherry, and walnut are popular choices for their durability and beautiful grain patterns. However, you may also want to consider the weight and cost of these materials, as they can significantly impact the final product.

In addition to the wood, you will also need to select hardware such as hinges, handles, and knobs. These should not only complement the design of the wardrobe but also be durable and functional.

#### 17.3b Joinery Techniques

Joinery is the process of connecting two or more pieces of wood to create a strong and stable structure. In advanced furniture making, there are various joinery techniques that can be used, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

One popular joinery technique for wardrobes is the dovetail joint. This joint is known for its strength and durability, making it ideal for furniture that will be used frequently. Another option is the mortise and tenon joint, which is commonly used in traditional furniture making and provides a clean and seamless look.

#### 17.3c Creating Intricate Designs

One of the most exciting aspects of advanced furniture making is the ability to create intricate and unique designs. This can be achieved through techniques such as carving, inlay, and marquetry.

Carving involves removing layers of wood to create a three-dimensional design. This can be done by hand or with the use of power tools. Inlay, on the other hand, involves inserting pieces of contrasting wood or other materials into the surface of the furniture to create a decorative pattern. Marquetry is similar to inlay, but it involves creating a design using different types of wood veneers.

#### 17.3d Final Assembly and Care

Once all the pieces of the wardrobe have been created, it is time for final assembly. This involves carefully fitting all the components together and securing them with the chosen joinery techniques. It is crucial to pay close attention to detail during this step to ensure the wardrobe is sturdy and well-constructed.

After the wardrobe is assembled, it is essential to properly care for it to maintain its beauty and functionality. This includes regularly dusting and polishing the wood, as well as checking for any loose joints or hardware. It is also important to avoid placing heavy objects on top of the wardrobe or using it as a surface for other activities, as this can cause damage over time.

In conclusion, creating an advanced wardrobe requires a combination of technical skills, creativity, and attention to detail. By carefully selecting materials, using proper joinery techniques, and incorporating intricate designs, you can create a beautiful and functional piece of furniture that will last for years to come. Remember to take your time and pay attention to detail during the final assembly and care process to ensure your wardrobe is of the highest quality.
