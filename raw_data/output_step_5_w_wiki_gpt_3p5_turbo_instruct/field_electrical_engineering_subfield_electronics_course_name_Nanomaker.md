This level of precision allows scientists and engineers to create new materials, devices, and systems with unique properties and functionalities. The term "nanotechnology" was first coined by Professor Norio Taniguchi in 1974, but the concept of manipulating matter at the nanoscale has been around for much longer.

The earliest description of nanotechnology can be traced back to a lecture given by physicist Richard Feynman in 1959, where he discussed the possibility of manipulating individual atoms and molecules. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that the term "nanotechnology" gained widespread recognition, thanks to the work of scientists such as Eric Drexler and K. Eric Drexler. They proposed the idea of molecular nanotechnology, which involved the precise manipulation of individual molecules to create macroscale products.

In 2000, the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) was established in the United States, which defined nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that at the nanoscale, quantum mechanical effects become significant and can be harnessed for various applications.

Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary field that encompasses various branches of science, including surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage, engineering, microfabrication, and molecular engineering.

### Section: 4.1 Basics of Nanophotonics

Nanophotonics is the study of the behavior of light at the nanoscale, where the dimensions of the structures involved are on the order of nanometers (10^-9 meters). At this scale, the properties of light and matter are significantly different from what we observe in our everyday lives. The behavior of light is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, and the interaction between light and matter becomes more complex.

One of the key concepts in nanophotonics is the concept of confinement. In traditional optics, light is confined by the boundaries of the medium it is traveling through, such as a fiber optic cable. In nanophotonics, light can be confined to structures that are smaller than the wavelength of light itself. This allows for the creation of devices with unprecedented capabilities, such as ultra-compact photonic circuits and high-resolution imaging systems.

Another important aspect of nanophotonics is the use of nanomaterials. These are materials that have at least one dimension on the nanoscale, and they exhibit unique optical properties due to their size and structure. For example, metal nanoparticles can exhibit plasmonic behavior, where the collective oscillation of electrons in the nanoparticle can enhance the interaction between light and matter.

To manipulate light at the nanoscale, various techniques are used, including near-field optics, surface plasmon resonance, and photonic crystals. These techniques allow for precise control and manipulation of light, enabling the creation of novel devices and applications.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of nanophotonics and nanooptics in various fields, including optoelectronics, microelectronics, and biomedicine. We will also discuss the potential for future developments in these fields and the impact they may have on our society. 


### Section: 4.2 Plasmonics and Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy

Plasmonics and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) are two important areas of research within the field of nanophotonics and nanooptics. Plasmonics deals with the manipulation of plasmons, which are collective oscillations of electrons in a metal nanoparticle, while SERS is a powerful analytical technique that utilizes plasmonic surfaces to enhance the Raman scattering signal of molecules.

The use of plasmonic surfaces in SERS was first demonstrated in the 1970s, and since then, it has become the most common method for performing SERS measurements. These surfaces are typically composed of a nanostructured noble metal, such as silver or gold, deposited onto a silicon or glass substrate. The metal nanoparticles can be prepared using various methods, including electrochemical roughening, lithography, or porous silicon as a support. Recently, two-dimensional silicon nanopillars decorated with silver have also been used as SERS active substrates.

The choice of metal for plasmonic surfaces in visible light SERS is typically silver or gold, but there has been growing interest in using aluminum as an alternative plasmonic material. This is because the plasmon band of aluminum is in the UV region, unlike silver and gold, which have their plasmon bands in the visible range. This makes aluminum a promising material for UV SERS. Surprisingly, aluminum has also been shown to have a large enhancement in the infrared region, which is not fully understood.

One of the challenges in using plasmonic surfaces for SERS is the cost of the substrates. To address this issue, researchers have explored the use of plasmonic paper, which has received widespread attention in the field. This approach involves creating highly sensitive SERS substrates through methods such as soaking, in-situ synthesis, screen printing, and inkjet printing. By reducing the cost of substrates, SERS can become a commonly used analytical chemistry measurement technique.

The shape and size of the metal nanoparticles on the plasmonic surface play a crucial role in the strength of the enhancement. This is because these factors influence the ratio of absorption and scattering events, which can significantly impact the SERS signal. Therefore, there is an ideal size and surface thickness for each experiment, and better control over these parameters can lead to a reduction in substrate costs.

In conclusion, plasmonics and SERS are two essential areas of research within nanophotonics and nanooptics. The manipulation of plasmons and the use of plasmonic surfaces in SERS have opened up new possibilities for controlling and detecting light at the nanoscale. With ongoing advancements in these fields, we can expect to see even more exciting applications in the future.

Metamaterials and negative index materials are another important aspect of nanoscale optics. These materials are artificially engineered to have properties that do not exist in nature. One of the key components of these materials are split-ring resonators (SRRs), which are small metallic structures that can manipulate electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale.

The first demonstration of a negative index of refraction was achieved using a periodic array of SRRs. This was accomplished by fabricating "square shaped SRRs" with lined wire configurations into a periodic, arrayed, cell structure. This metamaterial prism experiment, published in 2001, showed a negative index of refraction for the first time. Since then, SRRs have been used to fabricate left-handed metamaterials for the microwave and terahertz ranges, and have also been applied to acoustic metamaterials.

SRRs have also been used in combination with other structures to create left-handed materials, which have negative values of permittivity and permeability for a band of frequencies. This has led to the development of photonic bandgap materials, which have negative effective permittivity for certain frequency intervals. Additionally, SRRs have been used to focus a signal from a point source, increasing the transmission efficiency.

## Chapter 6: Nanofabrication Techniques

### Section 6.1: Top-down Nanofabrication

Top-down nanofabrication is a technique used to create structures and devices at the nanoscale by reducing the size of larger materials. This approach is based on traditional microfabrication methods, such as optical and electron-beam lithography, and thermal treatments. These methods allow for a high degree of control over the resulting structures, making it a popular choice for creating nanomaterials and devices.

One of the main advantages of top-down nanofabrication is the ability to create structures with precise dimensions and shapes. This is crucial for applications in nanoelectronics, where the size and shape of components can greatly affect their performance. Additionally, top-down techniques can be used to create a wide range of materials, including metallic thin films and etched semiconductor layers.

One example of a top-down approach is the use of lithography, which involves using a mask to selectively expose a material to light or electrons, creating a pattern on the surface. This pattern is then transferred onto the material through a series of chemical and physical processes, resulting in the desired structure. Other top-down techniques include nanoimprinting, where a pattern is pressed onto a material, and focused ion beam milling, where a beam of ions is used to etch away material.

While top-down nanofabrication offers precise control over the resulting structures, it is limited by the resolution of the fabrication methods. As the size of structures decreases, the resolution of these methods becomes a significant challenge. This is where bottom-up approaches come into play.

#### Subsection: Bottom-up Nanofabrication

Bottom-up nanofabrication involves using the chemical properties of single molecules to self-assemble into useful structures. This approach relies on molecular self-assembly and molecular recognition to create structures at the nanoscale. Unlike top-down techniques, bottom-up approaches do not require expensive equipment and can produce structures with higher resolution.

One example of a bottom-up approach is the use of self-assembly methods, where molecules are designed to interact with each other in a specific way, resulting in the formation of a desired structure. Another approach is the use of molecular recognition, where molecules are designed to bind to specific sites on a surface, allowing for the controlled placement of molecules.

While bottom-up techniques offer higher resolution and the potential for creating more complex structures, they are limited by the difficulty in achieving precise control over the assembly process. Additionally, the cost of producing these structures can be high, as they often require specialized materials and techniques.

A combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches can also be used, where nanoscale molecules are integrated into a top-down framework. This hybrid approach allows for the creation of more complex structures with precise control over their dimensions and properties.

In the next section, we will explore the tools and equipment used in nanofabrication techniques, including lithography and self-assembly methods. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of nanofabrication and the ethical considerations surrounding the use of these techniques. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the various techniques used in nanofabrication and their impact on the field of nanotechnology.


#### Subsection: Bottom-up Nanofabrication

Bottom-up nanofabrication is a technique used to create structures and devices at the nanoscale by assembling individual molecules into larger structures. This approach relies on the chemical properties of molecules to self-organize or self-assemble into useful conformations, or on positional assembly. Bottom-up approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and molecular recognition to create structures with precise dimensions and shapes.

One of the main advantages of bottom-up nanofabrication is the ability to create structures with extremely small dimensions. This is because the size of the resulting structures is limited only by the size of the individual molecules used in the process. This allows for the creation of nanomaterials and devices with unprecedented precision and control.

There are several different bottom-up approaches that can be used for nanofabrication. One common method is molecular self-assembly, where molecules are designed to interact with each other in a specific way, causing them to spontaneously form into a desired structure. Another approach is molecular recognition, where molecules are designed to selectively bind to each other, allowing for the creation of more complex structures.

One example of a bottom-up approach is the use of DNA origami, where DNA molecules are folded into specific shapes using complementary base pairing. This technique has been used to create a variety of nanoscale structures, including nanorobots and nanosensors.

While bottom-up nanofabrication offers precise control over the resulting structures, it can be limited by the complexity of the fabrication process. As the size and complexity of the structures increase, it becomes more challenging to design and control the self-assembly process. This is where a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches can be used to overcome these limitations.

By integrating nanoscale molecules into a top-down framework, it is possible to combine the precision and control of top-down techniques with the small size and complexity of bottom-up approaches. This hybrid approach has been used to create a variety of nanoscale devices, such as the carbon nanotube nanomotor mentioned in the related context.

In conclusion, bottom-up nanofabrication is a powerful technique for creating structures and devices at the nanoscale. It offers unprecedented control over the size and shape of structures, but can be limited by the complexity of the fabrication process. By combining bottom-up and top-down approaches, it is possible to overcome these limitations and create even more advanced nanoscale devices. 


#### Subsection: Lithography Techniques

Lithography is a key nanofabrication technique used to create patterns and structures at the nanoscale. It involves transferring a pattern onto a substrate, typically a thin film of material, using a mask or stencil. The pattern is then etched or deposited onto the substrate, resulting in the desired structure.

There are several types of lithography techniques, each with its own advantages and limitations. These include optical lithography, electron beam lithography, and nanoimprint lithography.

##### Optical Lithography

Optical lithography, also known as photolithography, is a widely used technique in the semiconductor industry for creating patterns on silicon wafers. It involves using light to transfer a pattern from a photomask, which contains the desired pattern, onto a photosensitive material called a photoresist. The photoresist is then developed, revealing the pattern on the substrate.

One of the main advantages of optical lithography is its high throughput, allowing for the creation of large numbers of identical structures in a short amount of time. However, it is limited by the diffraction limit of light, which restricts the resolution to around 100 nanometers.

##### Electron Beam Lithography

Electron beam lithography (EBL) is a high-resolution lithography technique that uses a focused beam of electrons to create patterns on a substrate. It offers much higher resolution than optical lithography, with the ability to create structures as small as a few nanometers.

EBL is often used in research and development for creating prototypes and small-scale production. However, it is a slow and expensive process, making it less suitable for large-scale manufacturing.

##### Nanoimprint Lithography

Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a relatively new technique that involves pressing a patterned mold onto a substrate coated with a thin layer of material. The material is then cured, creating a replica of the mold on the substrate.

NIL offers high resolution and the ability to create complex patterns, making it a promising technique for nanofabrication. However, it is limited by the availability of suitable molds and the potential for defects in the final product.

In addition to these techniques, there are also hybrid approaches that combine top-down and bottom-up methods. These include directed self-assembly, where top-down lithography is used to create patterns that guide the self-assembly of molecules, and block copolymer lithography, where self-assembling block copolymers are used to create patterns.

Overall, lithography techniques play a crucial role in nanofabrication, enabling the creation of structures and devices at the nanoscale. As technology continues to advance, new lithography techniques are being developed to push the limits of resolution and precision in nanofabrication.


#### Subsection: Additive Manufacturing

Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a rapidly growing nanofabrication technique that involves building three-dimensional objects layer by layer. It has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to create complex and customized structures with high precision and efficiency.

##### Types of Additive Manufacturing

There are several types of additive manufacturing techniques, each with its own unique process and materials. Some of the most commonly used methods include fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and selective laser sintering (SLS).

FDM is a popular method that involves extruding a thermoplastic material through a heated nozzle onto a build platform. The material is then cooled and solidified, creating a layer. The build platform then moves down and the process is repeated until the object is complete.

SLA uses a liquid resin that is cured by a laser or other light source, creating a solid layer. The build platform then moves down and the process is repeated until the object is complete. This method allows for high resolution and smooth surface finish.

SLS involves using a laser to selectively fuse powdered material, typically a polymer or metal, into a solid layer. The build platform then moves down and the process is repeated until the object is complete. This method is often used for creating functional prototypes and end-use parts.

##### Post-Processing and Finishing

Though additive manufacturing can produce high-quality parts, post-processing and finishing techniques can further improve the surface finish and dimensional accuracy. Some common methods include sanding, bead blasting, and chemical vapor processes.

Sandpaper and bead blasting can be used to smooth the surface of a 3D printed part, but it is important to consider the volume of material being removed to maintain dimensional accuracy. Chemical vapor processes, such as using acetone or similar solvents, can also improve the surface finish of certain polymers.

Another post-processing step that can benefit additive manufacturing is annealing. This involves heating the part to a specific temperature and then allowing it to cool, resulting in better internal layer bonding and improved mechanical properties. However, it may not be suitable for applications where dimensional accuracy is critical.

##### Additive/Subtractive Hybrid Manufacturing

Additive/subtractive hybrid manufacturing (ASHM) is a method that combines 3D printing with traditional subtractive manufacturing techniques. This allows for the creation of complex structures with high precision and surface finish. Machining operations can be completed after each layer or after the entire 3D print is complete, depending on the application requirements.

One of the main advantages of ASHM is its ability to achieve better surface finishes and dimensional accuracy compared to traditional additive manufacturing methods. This makes it a promising technique for creating functional prototypes and end-use parts.

##### Challenges and Future Directions

While additive manufacturing has many advantages, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main limitations is the restricted range of materials that can be used, as well as the limited mechanical properties of the printed parts. Researchers are currently exploring new materials and techniques to overcome these limitations and expand the capabilities of additive manufacturing.

In the future, additive manufacturing is expected to play a significant role in various industries, including aerospace, automotive, and healthcare. Its ability to create complex and customized structures with high precision and efficiency makes it a valuable tool for innovation and advancement in nanotechnology.

Nanolithography is a crucial step in the fabrication of nanoscale devices and structures. However, it is important to note that each method has its own limitations in terms of resolution, time consumption, and cost. Therefore, the choice of nanolithography technique depends on the specific needs and requirements of the desired product.

#### Photoresists

Photoresists are light-sensitive materials that are essential in the photolithography process. They are composed of a polymer, a sensitizer, and a solvent, each with a specific function. The polymer undergoes a structural change when exposed to radiation, while the solvent allows for the photoresist to be spun and form thin layers on a surface. The sensitizer, also known as an inhibitor, controls the photochemical reaction in the polymer phase.

Photoresists can be classified as positive or negative, depending on their response to light. In positive photoresists, the polymer undergoes a chemical change when exposed to light, making it more soluble in a developer solution. This allows for the desired pattern to be transferred onto the surface. In contrast, negative photoresists become less soluble when exposed to light, allowing for the unexposed areas to be removed during development.

In conclusion, nanolithography is a crucial technique in nanofabrication that allows for the precise patterning of materials at the nanoscale. It is a versatile method that is constantly evolving and improving, making it an essential tool in the development of nanotechnology.

## Chapter 7: Nanoscale Characterization:

### Section: 7.1 Scanning Probe Microscopy

Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a powerful tool for imaging and characterizing materials at the nanoscale. It allows for the visualization of surface topography, as well as the measurement of various physical and chemical properties, such as conductivity, magnetism, and chemical composition. One type of SPM, the scanning Hall probe microscope (SHPM), has become increasingly popular for its ability to map the magnetic induction associated with a sample.

Developed in 1996 by Oral, Bending, and Henini, SHPM combines the accurate sample approach and positioning of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) with a semiconductor Hall sensor. This allows for high spatial resolution (~300 nm) imaging with high magnetic field sensitivity. The SHPM utilizes 2D electron gas materials, such as GaAs/AlGaAs, to achieve these capabilities.

One of the major advantages of SHPM over other magnetic raster scanning methods is its noninvasive nature. Unlike the magnetic force microscope (MFM), which exerts a significant force on the underlying magnetic structure, the Hall probe has a negligible effect on the sample being measured. This allows for repeated scanning of the same area without causing damage to the sample. Additionally, the SHPM can operate at a wide range of temperatures (millikelvins to 300 K) and in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, making it suitable for a variety of applications.

However, there are some limitations to SHPM. One of the main challenges is the difficulty in achieving high magnetic field sensitivity while maintaining high spatial resolution. Additionally, the SHPM is limited to imaging only magnetic structures and cannot provide information on other properties, such as surface chemistry.

Despite these limitations, SHPM remains a valuable tool for nanoscale characterization. It can be combined with other scanning methods, such as STM, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a material's properties. Ongoing research and developments in this field continue to improve the capabilities and applications of SHPM, making it an essential tool for the advancement of nanotechnology.

### Section: 7.2 Electron Microscopy

Electron microscopy is a powerful tool for imaging and characterizing materials at the nanoscale. It allows for the visualization of surface topography, as well as the measurement of various physical and chemical properties, such as conductivity, magnetism, and chemical composition. One type of electron microscopy, the transmission electron microscope (TEM), has become increasingly popular for its ability to provide high-resolution images of materials at the atomic level.

The TEM works by passing a beam of electrons through a thin sample, which is typically less than 200 nanometers thick. The electrons interact with the atoms in the sample, producing an image that reveals the internal structure and composition of the material. The resolution of a TEM image is limited by the wavelength of the electrons, which is much smaller than that of visible light, allowing for the visualization of individual atoms.

One of the major advantages of TEM over other microscopy techniques is its ability to provide high-resolution images of both the surface and internal structure of a material. This makes it a valuable tool for studying the properties of nanomaterials, which often have unique surface and internal structures that affect their behavior. Additionally, TEM can be used to study a wide range of materials, including metals, semiconductors, and biological samples.

However, there are some limitations to TEM. One of the main challenges is the preparation of the sample, which must be thin enough to allow electrons to pass through but still maintain its structural integrity. This can be difficult for some materials, and the preparation process can introduce artifacts that may affect the accuracy of the results. Additionally, TEM is a time-consuming and expensive technique, requiring specialized equipment and trained personnel.

Despite these limitations, TEM remains a valuable tool for nanoscale characterization. It can be combined with other microscopy techniques, such as scanning probe microscopy, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a material's properties. Furthermore, advancements in technology have led to the development of new types of TEM, such as the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), which offers even higher resolution and the ability to study materials in real-time.

### Subsection: 7.2.1 Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)

The scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is a modified version of the TEM that offers even higher resolution and the ability to study materials in real-time. It works by scanning a focused beam of electrons across a sample, similar to a scanning electron microscope (SEM), but with much higher resolution. The electrons interact with the atoms in the sample, producing an image that reveals the internal structure and composition of the material.

One of the major advantages of STEM over traditional TEM is its ability to provide real-time imaging and analysis of materials. This allows for the observation of dynamic processes, such as chemical reactions and phase transformations, at the nanoscale. Additionally, STEM offers higher resolution than traditional TEM, with the ability to visualize individual atoms and their positions within a material.

However, like traditional TEM, STEM also has limitations. The preparation of the sample is still a crucial step, and the sample must be thin enough to allow electrons to pass through. Additionally, the high resolution of STEM requires a stable and well-aligned instrument, making it a time-consuming and expensive technique.

Despite these limitations, STEM has become an essential tool for nanoscale characterization, particularly in the fields of materials science and nanotechnology. It has allowed for groundbreaking research and discoveries, such as the visualization of individual atoms and the observation of nanoscale processes in real-time. As technology continues to advance, STEM is expected to play an even more significant role in the study of nanomaterials and their properties.

It involves shining a beam of light with a range of wavelengths onto a sample and measuring the amount of light absorbed or transmitted. This technique is particularly useful for studying the electronic properties of materials, as different electronic transitions can be observed in the UV and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

One application of UV-vis spectroscopy in nanotechnology is the detection of "S"-nitrosothiols (SNOs). SNOs are important molecules involved in various biological processes, and their detection is crucial for understanding their role in disease and health. UV-vis spectroscopy has been used to detect SNOs in biological samples, providing valuable insights into their behavior and function.

#### Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy

Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is another powerful technique for studying nanomaterials. It involves measuring the absorption of light in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which corresponds to the vibrational frequencies of molecules. This technique is particularly useful for studying the chemical composition of materials, as different molecules have unique vibrational frequencies that can be identified using MIR spectroscopy.

One example of the application of MIR spectroscopy in nanotechnology is the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope. MIRI has 10 filters available for observations, allowing for the study of a wide range of materials in space. This instrument has been used to study the composition of interstellar dust and the atmospheres of exoplanets, providing valuable insights into the chemical makeup of our universe.

#### Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique that measures the absorption or emission of infrared light by a material. It involves shining a beam of light with a range of frequencies onto a sample and measuring the amount of light absorbed or transmitted. This technique is particularly useful for studying the chemical composition and structure of materials, as different chemical bonds have unique vibrational frequencies that can be identified using FTIR.

One of the main advantages of FTIR over other spectroscopy techniques is its ability to provide high-resolution spectra over a wide range of frequencies. This makes it a valuable tool for studying the properties of nanomaterials, which often have unique chemical bonds and structures that affect their behavior. Additionally, FTIR can be used to study a wide range of materials, including solids, liquids, and gases.

### Section: 7.4 X-ray Diffraction

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a powerful technique for characterizing the structure of materials at the nanoscale. It involves shining a beam of X-rays onto a sample and measuring the diffraction pattern produced. This diffraction pattern provides valuable information about the crystal structure, lattice spacing, and orientation of the material.

#### Microscopy Imaging Techniques

In addition to providing structural information, XRD can also be used for imaging at the nanoscale. This is achieved through the use of microscopy imaging techniques, such as interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) and coherent diffraction imaging (CDI).

iSCAT has been used in multiple applications, including imaging of biological samples and nanomaterials. It involves shining a coherent beam of light onto a sample and measuring the scattered light. The resulting diffraction pattern can then be used to reconstruct an image of the sample.

Similarly, CDI also utilizes a coherent beam of light, but instead of using a traditional objective lens, computational algorithms and software are used to convert the diffraction pattern into a real-space image. This allows for higher resolution imaging of nanomaterials, as the wavelength of the incident light can be decreased to provide clearer images.

The imaging process in CDI can be broken down into four simple steps: 1) the coherent beam scatters from the sample, 2) the modulus of the Fourier transform is measured, 3) computational algorithms are used to retrieve phases, and 4) the image is recovered by inverse Fourier transform.

To begin, a highly coherent light source, such as x-rays or electrons, is incident on the sample. The beam is then scattered by the sample, producing a diffraction pattern that is representative of the Fourier transform of the sample's features. This diffraction pattern is then collected by a detector and evaluated using computational algorithms to reconstruct an image.

One advantage of CDI is its ability to provide high-resolution images without the need for expensive and complex equipment. However, it does require a sufficient amount of redundancy in the reconstruction process, which is achieved by detecting and overlapping a few hundred incident rays.

In conclusion, X-ray diffraction, combined with microscopy imaging techniques such as iSCAT and CDI, is a powerful tool for characterizing and imaging nanomaterials. Its ability to provide structural information and high-resolution images makes it an essential technique in the field of nanotechnology.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a powerful technique for characterizing the structure of materials at the nanoscale. It involves shining a beam of X-rays onto a sample and measuring the diffraction pattern produced. This diffraction pattern provides valuable information about the crystal structure, lattice spacing, and orientation of the material.

#### Atomic Force Microscopy

In addition to providing structural information, XRD can also be used for imaging at the nanoscale. Another powerful imaging technique is atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM utilizes a sharp probe to scan the surface of a sample, measuring the forces between the probe and the sample. This allows for high-resolution imaging of the surface topography and mechanical properties of materials at the nanoscale.

##### Photoconductive Atomic Force Microscopy

One specific type of AFM is photoconductive atomic force microscopy (pc-AFM). This technique combines the capabilities of AFM with the ability to measure changes in local and nano-scale electrical properties that result from the photonic effect. The main components and instrumentation of pc-AFM are identical to that required for traditional AFM, with the addition of an optical illumination component (laser).

Early in development, the main concerns regarding pc-AFM included physical configuration, laser disturbance, and laser alignment. These concerns have been addressed through modifications to the traditional AFM instrumentation. For example, a prism can be placed between the sample tip and the surface to allow for focused laser illumination without disturbing other units.

##### Interferometric Scattering Microscopy and Coherent Diffraction Imaging

In addition to XRD and AFM, there are other microscopy imaging techniques that can be used for nanoscale characterization. Interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) and coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) are two such techniques.

iSCAT involves shining a coherent beam of light onto a sample and measuring the scattered light. The resulting diffraction pattern can then be used to reconstruct an image of the sample. This technique has been used in multiple applications, including imaging of biological samples and nanomaterials.

### Section: 7.4 X-ray Diffraction

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a powerful technique for characterizing the structure of materials at the nanoscale. It involves shining a beam of X-rays onto a sample and measuring the diffraction pattern produced. This diffraction pattern provides valuable information about the crystal structure, lattice spacing, and orientation of the material.

#### Atomic Force Microscopy

In addition to providing structural information, XRD can also be used for imaging at the nanoscale. Another powerful imaging technique is atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM utilizes a sharp probe to scan the surface of a sample, measuring the forces between the probe and the sample. This allows for high-resolution imaging of the surface topography and mechanical properties of materials at the nanoscale.

##### Photoconductive Atomic Force Microscopy

One specific type of AFM is photoconductive atomic force microscopy (pc-AFM). This technique combines the capabilities of AFM with the ability to measure changes in local and nano-scale electrical properties that result from the photonic effect. The main components and instrumentation of pc-AFM are identical to that required for traditional AFM, with the addition of an optical illumination component (laser).

Early in development, the main concerns regarding pc-AFM included physical configuration, laser disturbance, and laser alignment. These concerns have been addressed through modifications to the traditional AFM instrumentation. For example, a prism can be placed between the sample tip and the surface to allow for focused laser illumination without disturbing other units.

##### Interferometric Scattering Microscopy and Coherent Diffraction Imaging

In addition to XRD and AFM, there are other microscopy imaging techniques that can be used for nanoscale characterization. Interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) and coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) are two such techniques that have gained popularity in recent years.

iSCAT is a label-free imaging technique that utilizes the interference of scattered light to create high-resolution images of nanoscale objects. It is particularly useful for studying biological samples, as it does not require any staining or labeling of the sample.

CDI, on the other hand, is a technique that uses coherent X-ray or electron beams to create images of nanoscale objects. It is similar to XRD in that it relies on the diffraction pattern produced by the sample, but it has the advantage of being able to produce images of non-crystalline materials as well.

Another method is filter-based occupational hygiene sampling, which uses electron microscopy and elemental analysis to identify the specific NPs of interest. This method involves placing samplers in the personal breathing zone of the worker, as close to the nose and mouth as possible, to accurately measure their exposure.

The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed a Technical Report: Occupational Exposure Sampling for Engineered Nanomaterials, which provides guidance for workplace sampling for three commonly used NPs: carbon nanotubes and nanofibers, silver, and titanium dioxide. These NPs have established NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) based on their elemental mass. For other engineered NPs that do not have established exposure limits, NIOSH has developed the Nanomaterial Exposure Assessment Technique (NEAT) 2.0. This sampling strategy involves using filter samples in both the worker's personal breathing zone and as area samples. The filter samples are then analyzed for elemental composition and morphological data using electron microscopy, providing a qualitative assessment of the particle size and distribution.

It is important to note that exposure assessment for NPs can be challenging due to the diverse nature of these materials and their potential interactions with various substances. Uncertainties such as impurities and biological variability must be taken into account during testing to ensure accurate results. Additionally, the way in which NPs disperse in the environment can also impact their toxicity, highlighting the importance of thorough characterization of NPs in the laboratory conducting the testing.
