One of the most commonly used assistive devices is the wheelchair, which provides mobility and accessibility for individuals with mobility impairments. In this chapter, we will discuss the principles and practice of wheelchair use, with a focus on contextual inquiry in wheelchair design.

### Subsection: 6.1a Conducting Contextual Inquiry in Wheelchair Design

Contextual inquiry is a user-centered design research method that is part of the contextual design methodology. It involves a structured, one-on-one interaction between the researcher and the user, where the researcher observes the user's normal activities and discusses them with the user. This method is particularly useful in understanding the needs and preferences of wheelchair users, as it allows for a deeper understanding of their daily routines and challenges.

The contextual inquiry defines four principles to guide the interaction. First, the user's normal activities are observed and discussed. This allows the researcher to gain insight into the user's needs and preferences in a natural setting. Second, if specific tasks are important, the user may be asked to perform those tasks. This provides a more detailed understanding of the user's abilities and limitations. Third, the interview may have three phases, which are not formally separated but may include pre-interview, interview, and post-interview activities. Finally, the data gathered from the contextual inquiry is analyzed through interpretation sessions, where the research team discusses and adds insights and facts to the data.

Before conducting a contextual inquiry, it is important to set up user visits. The users selected should be currently engaged in work of interest, able to have the researcher come into their workplace, and represent a diverse range of users. The number of users needed for a contextual inquiry can vary, but it is recommended to gather data from at least four users for a single, small task, and up to 30 or more for a more comprehensive understanding.

Following the contextual inquiry field interview, the data is analyzed through interpretation sessions. This involves the researcher retelling the story of the interview in chronological order, while the team adds individual insights and facts as notes. The team may also use the data to create work models and organize the notes using an affinity diagram. This data can also be used to generate in-depth personas, which can aid in the design and development of wheelchair technology.

Contextual inquiries can be conducted for various purposes, such as understanding the needs of a market, scoping opportunities, or understanding the work of specific roles or tasks. In the context of wheelchair design, contextual inquiries can provide valuable insights into the needs and preferences of wheelchair users, allowing for the development of more effective and user-friendly designs.
