## Foreward

Welcome to "Cyberpolitics in International Relations: Theory, Methods, Policy". In this book, we explore the intersection of two rapidly evolving fields - international relations and cyberpolitics. As technology continues to advance and shape our world, it is crucial for us to understand its impact on global politics.

The study of international relations has long been dominated by traditional theories and methods, but in recent years, scholars have turned to psychology to better understand decision-making in world politics. This book builds upon this trend by examining the role of cognition and emotion in cyberpolitics.

Through the lens of psychological approaches, we delve into a wide range of topics, from nuclear strategy and proliferation to conflict management and resolution. We draw on insights from cognitive psychology, which has shown that human behavior often deviates from the expectations of traditional rational choice models. By exploring concepts such as misperception, belief systems, and heuristics, we gain a deeper understanding of how leaders make decisions in the cyber realm.

Furthermore, we also draw on social psychology, which highlights the fundamental human need for identity. In today's interconnected world, where cyber attacks can have far-reaching consequences, understanding the role of identity in cyberpolitics is crucial.

This book is not just a theoretical exploration, but also a practical guide for policymakers and practitioners. By examining case studies and real-world examples, we provide insights and recommendations for navigating the complex landscape of cyberpolitics.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, scholars, and policymakers alike. As the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, it is essential for us to understand its impact on international relations. We hope that this book will contribute to the ongoing discourse and understanding of cyberpolitics in the field of international relations.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. Let's dive into the fascinating world of cyberpolitics together.

### Section 1.1: Evolution of International Relations - Structure, Process, and Levels of Analysis

#### Subsection 1.1b: Key Concepts and Theories

In order to fully understand the impact of cyberspace on international relations, it is important to explore key concepts and theories that have emerged in this field. These concepts and theories provide a framework for analyzing the complex relationship between technology and politics.

One key concept is the idea of "cyberpower," which refers to the ability of a state or actor to use cyberspace to achieve its goals and influence others. This concept has been further developed into the concept of "cybersecurity," which encompasses the protection of information and communication systems from cyber attacks.

Another important concept is "cyber sovereignty," which refers to a state's right to govern and regulate its own cyberspace. This concept has become increasingly relevant as countries grapple with issues such as internet censorship and data privacy.

In terms of theories, the "realist" perspective suggests that states will use cyberspace to gain power and advantage over others, leading to a constant struggle for dominance. On the other hand, the "liberal" perspective emphasizes the potential for cooperation and mutual benefit in cyberspace.

The "levels of analysis" framework is also useful in understanding the impact of cyberspace on international relations. This framework suggests that events and actions can be analyzed at different levels, including the individual, state, and international levels. In the context of cyberspace, this framework can help us understand how individual hackers, state-sponsored cyber attacks, and international cyber treaties all play a role in shaping the dynamics of international relations.

As we delve deeper into the field of cyberpolitics, these key concepts and theories will provide a foundation for understanding the complex relationship between technology and international relations.

As technology continues to advance and shape our world, it has become increasingly important to understand the role of cyberspace in international relations. Cyberspace, defined as the interconnected network of digital information and communication systems, has become a critical component of global politics and has greatly impacted the structure, process, and levels of analysis in international relations.

One of the key ways in which cyberspace has influenced international relations is through the concept of "cyberpower." With the rise of cyber attacks and the use of technology for political gain, states and actors now have the ability to exert power and influence through cyberspace. This has led to a new form of power struggle in the international arena, where states must not only compete for military and economic power, but also for cyberpower.

Another important concept is "cybersecurity," which refers to the protection of information and communication systems from cyber attacks. As the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, the threat of cyber attacks has become a major concern for governments and organizations. This has led to the development of cybersecurity policies and strategies, as well as the establishment of international partnerships and agreements to address this issue.

The concept of "cyber sovereignty" has also emerged as a result of the growing influence of cyberspace in international relations. This concept refers to a state's right to govern and regulate its own cyberspace. With the rise of internet censorship and data privacy concerns, many countries have asserted their right to control their own cyberspace, leading to debates and tensions between states.

In terms of theories, the impact of cyberspace on international relations can be viewed through both the "realist" and "liberal" perspectives. Realists argue that states will use cyberspace to gain power and advantage over others, leading to a constant struggle for dominance. On the other hand, liberals emphasize the potential for cooperation and mutual benefit in cyberspace, as seen in the development of international organizations and agreements related to cyberspace.

The "levels of analysis" framework is also useful in understanding the role of cyberspace in international relations. This framework suggests that events and actions can be analyzed at different levels, including the individual, state, and international levels. In the context of cyberspace, this framework can help us understand how individual hackers, state-sponsored cyber attacks, and international cyber treaties all play a role in shaping the dynamics of international relations.

In conclusion, the evolution of cyberspace has greatly impacted the field of international relations. From the concept of cyberpower to the development of cybersecurity policies and the emergence of cyber sovereignty, cyberspace has become a critical factor in global politics.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Cyberspace and International Relations:

### Section: 1.2 The Construction of Cyberspace- Concepts and Complexities:

### Subsection (optional): 1.2a Definition and Characteristics of Cyberspace

Cyberspace is a term that has been used in various contexts and has evolved over time. It is often defined as the interconnected network of digital information and communication systems, but there is no universally agreed upon definition. In fact, there are 28 different definitions of cyberspace according to F. D. Kramer, highlighting the complexities and nuances of this concept. In this section, we will explore the definition and characteristics of cyberspace, and how it has evolved to become a critical component of international relations.

One of the most recent definitions of cyberspace is provided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Department of Defense, which defines it as one of five interdependent domains, along with land, air, maritime, and space. This definition highlights the growing recognition of cyberspace as a distinct and important domain in international relations. However, it is important to note that this definition is not universally accepted and there are ongoing debates about the boundaries and characteristics of cyberspace.

Cyberspace is often described as an internet metaphor, where objects and identities exist within the communication network itself. This means that events taking place on the internet are not physically located in the same place as the participants or servers, but rather in this virtual space. This interpretation of cyberspace is influenced by the philosopher Michel Foucault's concept of heterotopias, which refers to spaces that are both physical and mental.

In addition to being a virtual space, cyberspace is also characterized by its flow of digital data through interconnected computers. This means that it is not a tangible object that can be physically located, but it has real effects on the physical world. This has led to several attempts to create models and theories to understand how cyberspace works, as it is not a traditional domain like land or sea.

Another important characteristic of cyberspace is its role in shaping power dynamics in international relations. With the rise of cyber attacks and the use of technology for political gain, states and actors now have the ability to exert power and influence through cyberspace. This has led to a new form of power struggle in the international arena, where states must compete not only for military and economic power, but also for cyberpower.

The growing influence of cyberspace has also led to the emergence of concepts such as cybersecurity and cyber sovereignty. Cybersecurity refers to the protection of information and communication systems from cyber attacks, which has become a major concern for governments and organizations. This has led to the development of policies and strategies to address this issue, as well as international partnerships and agreements.

On the other hand, cyber sovereignty refers to a state's right to govern and regulate its own cyberspace. With the rise of internet censorship and data privacy concerns, many countries have asserted their right to control their own cyberspace. This has led to debates and tensions between states, highlighting the complexities of cyberspace in international relations.

In conclusion, cyberspace is a complex and constantly evolving concept that has become a critical component of international relations. Its definition and characteristics continue to be debated, but it is clear that it has a significant impact on power dynamics, security, and sovereignty in the global arena. In the following sections, we will explore the theories, methods, and policies related to cyberspace in international relations.

The evolution of cyberspace has been driven by advancements in technology, particularly in the areas of communication and information systems. The development of the World Wide Web, email, and social media platforms have transformed cyberspace into a global network that connects individuals, organizations, and governments from all over the world. This has had a profound impact on international relations, as it has enabled new forms of communication, collaboration, and conflict.

One of the key characteristics of cyberspace is its borderless nature. Unlike traditional domains such as land, air, and sea, cyberspace knows no physical boundaries. This has created new challenges for international relations, as traditional concepts of sovereignty and territoriality do not easily apply in this virtual space. As a result, there have been ongoing debates and negotiations among states about the governance and regulation of cyberspace.

Another important aspect of the evolution of cyberspace is the increasing interconnectedness of different domains. As technology continues to advance, the boundaries between cyberspace and other domains such as land, air, and sea are becoming increasingly blurred. This has led to the emergence of new forms of hybrid warfare, where cyber attacks are used in conjunction with traditional military tactics.

In conclusion, the evolution of cyberspace has had a significant impact on international relations, shaping the way states interact and conduct their affairs. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that cyberspace will continue to evolve and present new challenges and opportunities for the international community. In the following sections, we will explore the theories, methods, and policies that are used to understand and navigate this complex and ever-changing domain.

### Section: 3.4 Cyber Espionage and Surveillance:

Cyber espionage and surveillance are two forms of cyber threats that have become increasingly prevalent in international relations. These tactics involve the unauthorized access and gathering of sensitive information from individuals, organizations, or governments. In this section, we will define cyber espionage and surveillance and explore the different types of these threats.

#### Subsection: 3.4b Impact of Cyber Espionage on International Relations

The impact of cyber espionage on international relations is significant and far-reaching. As mentioned in the previous subsection, cyber espionage is often carried out by state actors, making it a tool of statecraft in the realm of international relations. The use of cyber espionage can have both positive and negative effects on international relations, depending on the perspective and goals of the actors involved.

On one hand, cyber espionage can be seen as a means for states to gather valuable intelligence and gain a strategic advantage over their adversaries. This can include gathering information on military capabilities, economic policies, and political strategies. In this sense, cyber espionage can be seen as a tool for maintaining national security and protecting a state's interests.

However, the use of cyber espionage can also have negative consequences for international relations. The unauthorized access and theft of sensitive information can lead to tensions and mistrust between states. This can result in diplomatic disputes and even escalate to cyber conflicts or traditional warfare. In addition, the use of cyber espionage can also damage the reputation and credibility of a state, as it goes against the principles of transparency and trust in international relations.

Furthermore, the impact of cyber espionage is not limited to state actors. Non-state actors, such as terrorist organizations or hacktivist groups, can also use cyber espionage to gather sensitive information and carry out attacks. This can have serious implications for international security and stability, as these actors may not be bound by the same rules and norms as states.

In conclusion, the impact of cyber espionage on international relations is complex and multifaceted. While it can provide states with valuable intelligence and strategic advantages, it can also lead to tensions and conflicts between states.

# Collaborative Information Seeking

### Control, Communication, and Awareness

Collaborative information seeking (CIS) is a process in which individuals or groups work together to achieve a common goal by sharing information and resources. In order for CIS to be successful, there are three key components that must be present: control, communication, and awareness. These components are highly prevalent in the literature on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and are essential for understanding and designing effective CIS systems.

#### Control

Control refers to the ability of individuals or groups to manage and direct the flow of information and resources within a collaborative setting. In CSCW systems, control is often represented through formal structures such as roles and rules. For example, the COSMOS project utilized roles to represent different individuals or automatons within the system, such as a supervisor, processor, or analyst. Rules were also used to represent the flow and processes within the system, such as conditions that needed to be met for a process to start or finish. This type of control system is known as a procedural-based system.

In the context of CIS, control is crucial for managing the flow of information and resources among collaborators. It allows for a clear division of tasks and responsibilities, ensuring that the collaboration runs smoothly and efficiently. However, too much control can also hinder collaboration by limiting the autonomy and creativity of individuals. Finding the right balance of control is essential for successful CIS.

#### Communication

Communication is a fundamental component of any collaboration. In fact, Rodden (1991) identified communication systems as the most mature and widely used class of systems in CSCW. In CIS, communication is essential for facilitating the exchange of information and ideas among collaborators. It allows for the coordination of tasks and the sharing of resources, ultimately leading to the achievement of the common goal.

In the context of CIS, communication can take various forms, such as face-to-face interactions, email, instant messaging, or video conferencing. The mode of communication used can greatly impact the effectiveness of the collaboration. For example, face-to-face interactions may be more suitable for brainstorming and idea generation, while email may be better for sharing documents and updates.

#### Awareness

Awareness refers to the ability of individuals or groups to understand the actions and intentions of others within a collaborative setting. In CIS, awareness is crucial for maintaining a shared understanding of the collaboration and its progress. It allows for the identification of potential issues and the adaptation of strategies to overcome them.

In CSCW, awareness is often facilitated through the use of technology, such as shared workspaces or status indicators. In CIS, awareness can be enhanced through the use of collaborative tools that allow for real-time updates and notifications. This helps to keep all collaborators on the same page and promotes a sense of shared responsibility.

### Types of Cyber Cooperation

In the context of international relations, cyber cooperation refers to the collaboration between countries to address cyber threats and promote a safe and secure cyberspace.

This commission, chaired by Carl Bildt, works towards developing recommendations for the future of global internet governance. It is considered one of the international initiatives that facilitate effective cooperation between relevant international actors, particularly according to the principles of internet governance.

However, there are also new sources of discord in the global agenda for cyber politics. One example is the criticism from some countries against the current attempts at a multistakeholder process in internet governance. These countries argue that the process is led by Western nations and does not adequately represent the interests of all stakeholders. This has led to tensions and disagreements in international discussions on cyber governance.

Another case study of new discord in cyber politics is the Council on Foreign Relations task force report no. 80 (2022). This report, completed in May 2022, recommends that the U.S. reconsider its cyber, digital trade, and online freedom policies, which have been championing a free and open internet. The report argues that these policies have failed and calls for a reassessment of the U.S.'s approach to cyber issues.

In addition, the recent NCSC ransomware speech at Tel Aviv Cyber Week (2022) also highlights the new discord in cyber politics. During this speech, the 12th annual event was disrupted by a ransomware attack, demonstrating the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber threats. This incident has raised concerns about the need for stronger cybersecurity measures and international cooperation in addressing cyber threats.

Overall, these case studies illustrate the complex and evolving nature of the global agenda in cyber politics. While there are emerging accords and efforts towards international cooperation, there are also new sources of discord and challenges that must be addressed in order to effectively govern cyber activities in the international arena.

### Section: 5.4 The Impact of Non-State Actors on International Cyber Politics:

Non-state actors, such as private companies, non-governmental organizations, and individuals, play a significant role in shaping international cyber politics. In this section, we will explore the various ways in which these actors influence the landscape of cyber politics and the potential implications for global governance and cooperation.

#### "Role of Non-State Actors in Cyber Politics"

Non-state actors have become increasingly involved in cyber politics, both as targets and perpetrators of cyber attacks, and as key players in shaping policies and regulations. Private companies, in particular, have a significant impact on the development and implementation of technology, as they often have the resources and expertise to create and maintain digital infrastructure. This influence can be seen in the development of self-sovereign identity (SSI) technology.

SSI is a value-laden technology that allows individuals to have control over their digital identities. However, its implementation can vary significantly, and different actors may embed their own goals and intentions into the technology. For example, private companies may prioritize profit and data collection, while non-governmental organizations may prioritize privacy and security. This can lead to semantic confusion, as the term "self-sovereign identity" may create expectations of absolute control and ownership over digital identities, which may not align with the reality of complex technical infrastructure and legal frameworks.

Furthermore, the role of non-state actors in cyber politics raises concerns about digital literacy and social inequalities. SSI assumes reliable internet connectivity, access to compatible devices, and proficiency in navigating digital systems. This can exclude marginalized populations, such as the elderly or individuals in developing regions, from accessing the benefits of SSI. As such, it is crucial for non-state actors to consider the potential implications of their actions on global governance and cooperation.

In addition to their impact on technology, non-state actors also play a role in shaping policies and regulations in cyberspace. The government's regulatory role in cyberspace is complicated, as some view it as a virtual space that should remain free of government intervention. However, others argue that the government has a crucial role in protecting national infrastructure and regulating companies and organizations to prevent cyber attacks.

In conclusion, non-state actors have a significant impact on international cyber politics, both in terms of technology development and policy-making. As technology continues to advance and shape our world, it is important for these actors to consider the potential implications of their actions on global governance and cooperation.

SSI assumes reliable internet connectivity, access to compatible devices, and proficiency in navigating digital systems. This can exclude marginalized populations, such as the elderly or individuals in developing regions, from accessing the benefits of SSI. As such, it is crucial for policymakers to consider the potential impact of SSI on different populations and ensure that measures are in place to address any potential inequalities.

In addition to shaping technology and policies, non-state actors also play a significant role in cyber attacks and cyber warfare. Private companies may be targeted by state-sponsored cyber attacks, as seen in the case of the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, where North Korea was suspected of targeting the company in response to the release of a film depicting the assassination of their leader. Non-governmental organizations may also be targeted for their political or social activism, as seen in the case of the 2016 Democratic National Committee hack, where Russian hackers targeted the organization in an attempt to influence the US presidential election.

The involvement of non-state actors in cyber attacks raises questions about accountability and responsibility. Unlike state actors, non-state actors do not have the same level of accountability and may not be subject to the same consequences for their actions. This can create challenges in terms of international cooperation and response to cyber attacks, as there may not be clear lines of responsibility.

In conclusion, non-state actors have a significant impact on international cyber politics, from shaping technology and policies to being involved in cyber attacks. As technology continues to advance and non-state actors become more involved in cyber politics, it is crucial for policymakers to consider their role and potential implications for global governance and cooperation.

This can exclude marginalized populations, such as the elderly or individuals in developing regions, from accessing the benefits of SSI. This exclusion can further exacerbate existing social inequalities and create a digital divide between those who have access to SSI and those who do not.

#### "Case Studies of Non-State Actors in Cyber Politics"

To better understand the impact of non-state actors on international cyber politics, it is essential to examine case studies of their involvement. One such case study is the development of the Open Source Enterprise (OSE) by the United States intelligence agencies. The OSE is a collaborative effort between government agencies, private companies, and academic institutions to gather and analyze open-source intelligence. This partnership highlights the significant role that private companies play in shaping cyber politics, as they provide the technology and expertise necessary for the OSE's success.

Another case study is the implementation of self-sovereign identity by various non-state actors. For example, the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT) has developed its own SSI framework, which prioritizes privacy and security. In contrast, private companies, such as Microsoft and IBM, have also implemented SSI technology, but with a focus on data collection and profit. These differing implementations of SSI highlight the potential for conflicting interests and goals among non-state actors in shaping cyber politics.

#### "Challenges and Opportunities for Global Governance and Cooperation"

The involvement of non-state actors in cyber politics presents both challenges and opportunities for global governance and cooperation. On one hand, their involvement can lead to conflicting interests and goals, making it difficult to establish unified policies and regulations. On the other hand, their expertise and resources can also contribute to the development of effective solutions to cyber threats.

To address these challenges and harness the opportunities presented by non-state actors, it is crucial to promote digital civics. Digital civics, as defined by Clements, involves four underlying pillars: philosophy, history, ethics, and technology. By grounding digital civics in these pillars, we can promote a more holistic and ethical approach to cyber politics, taking into account the diverse perspectives and interests of non-state actors.

In conclusion, non-state actors play a significant role in shaping international cyber politics, and their involvement presents both challenges and opportunities for global governance and cooperation. By examining case studies and promoting digital civics, we can better understand and navigate the impact of non-state actors in this complex and ever-evolving landscape.

## Chapter 6: The Evolution of Cyber Norms and Rules

### Section 6.1: The Role of International Organizations in Cyber Governance

International organizations play a crucial role in the development and enforcement of cyber norms and rules. These organizations serve as platforms for international cooperation and coordination, and their efforts have been instrumental in shaping the landscape of cyberpolitics in international relations.

One of the key international organizations involved in cyber governance is the Global Commission on Internet Governance (GCIG). Established in 2014, the GCIG is an independent body composed of experts from various fields, including government, academia, and the private sector. Its primary goal is to make recommendations about the future of global internet governance and promote effective cooperation between relevant international actors.

The GCIG's research advisory network, led by Laura DeNardis, produces original research on internet governance topics such as the dark web, cybersecurity, and internet freedom. For instance, a research published in January 2017 entitled "Who Runs the Internet? The Global Multi-stakeholder Model of Internet Governance" described a "multistakeholder" framework wherein the management of the global internet architecture is in the hands of a cluster of international stakeholders such as industry, academic, and non-governmental actors. This research has been influential in shaping the GCIG's approach to cyber governance.

In addition to its research efforts, the GCIG has also published several documents related to cyber norms and rules. These include the "Norm to Protect the Public Core" and the "Definition of the Public Core, to which the Norm Applies". These documents provide a standardized description of the critical elements of the internet that should be protected from cyber attacks and interference by state actors. The GCIG's efforts have been recognized and utilized by other international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

## Chapter 6: The Evolution of Cyber Norms and Rules

### Section 6.2: Case Studies: Cyber Politics in Different Regions of the World

As the internet continues to play an increasingly important role in international relations, it is essential to examine how different regions of the world are approaching cyber politics. In this section, we will explore the unique challenges and approaches to cyber governance in North America.

### Subsection 6.2a: Cyber Politics in North America

North America, consisting of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, has been at the forefront of the development and use of cyberspace. With advanced technological infrastructure and a high level of internet penetration, the region has become a major player in the global digital economy. However, this also makes it a prime target for cyber attacks and raises concerns about the protection of critical infrastructure and personal data.

The United States, as a global superpower, has been a key player in shaping cyber norms and rules. The country has taken a multi-stakeholder approach to cyber governance, involving government, industry, academia, and civil society in decision-making processes. This approach has been heavily influenced by the research and recommendations of the Global Commission on Internet Governance (GCIG), which has highlighted the importance of collaboration between different stakeholders in managing the internet.

One of the key challenges in North America is the protection of personal data and privacy. With the rise of social media and online platforms, there has been a growing concern about the collection and use of personal data by companies and governments. In response, the United States has implemented various laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to protect the privacy of its citizens.

Canada, on the other hand, has taken a more proactive approach to cyber governance. In 2010, the country established the Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre (CCIRC) to coordinate and respond to cyber threats. The CCIRC works closely with government agencies, the private sector, and international partners to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks.

## Chapter 7: Cyber Security and International Law:

### Section: 7.1 The Role of International Law in Cyber Security:

The increasing reliance on technology and the internet has brought about new challenges in the realm of international relations. With the rise of cyber attacks, cyber security has become a major concern for governments and international organizations. In this section, we will explore the role of international law in addressing these threats and promoting cyber security.

#### 7.1a Role of International Law in Cyber Security

International law plays a crucial role in regulating state behavior in the cyber domain. It provides a framework for addressing cyber threats and promoting cooperation among states. The principal global treaty-based legal instrument relating to cyber security is the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, 23 Nov 2001), also known as the Budapest Convention. This convention, overseen by the Council of Europe, has signatories worldwide and provides a global scope for addressing cybercrime.

Individual countries also have their own legal requirements relating to lawful interception, which is the process of monitoring and collecting data from electronic communications. For example, in the United Kingdom, the law is known as RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act), while in the United States there is an array of federal and state criminal laws. In Commonwealth of Independent States countries, the law is known as SORM.

In the European Union, the European Council Resolution of 17 January 1995 on the Lawful Interception of Telecommunications mandated similar measures to the US's Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) on a pan-European basis. However, some EU member countries initially had privacy concerns and were reluctant to accept this resolution. Nevertheless, there now appears to be general agreement with the resolution. Interception mandates in Europe are generally more rigorous than those in the US, with both voice and ISP public network operators in the Netherlands being required to support interception capabilities for years.

Europe continues to maintain its global leadership role in this sector through the adoption of the Data Retention Directive by the European Parliament and Council in 2006. This directive applies broadly to almost all public electronic communications and requires the capture of most related information, including location, for every communication. The information must be stored for a period of at least six months and up to two years, depending on the country.

The role of international law in cyber security also extends to the establishment of international legal frameworks and agreements. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security is one such framework. This group, composed of experts from various countries, works to promote international cooperation and develop norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace.

However, applying traditional international law principles to the cyber domain can be challenging. One of the main difficulties is attributing cyber attacks to specific actors. Unlike traditional warfare, where the source of an attack can often be identified, cyber attacks can be launched from anywhere in the world, making it difficult to determine the responsible party. Additionally, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of cyber warfare, which makes it challenging to apply existing laws and regulations to cyber attacks.

In conclusion, international law plays a crucial role in promoting cyber security and regulating state behavior in the cyber domain. However, there are challenges and limitations in applying traditional international law principles to the ever-evolving world of cyber security. As technology continues to advance, it is essential for international law to adapt and evolve to effectively address cyber threats and promote cooperation among states.


## Chapter 7: Cyber Security and International Law:

### Section: 7.1 The Role of International Law in Cyber Security:

The increasing reliance on technology and the internet has brought about new challenges in the realm of international relations. With the rise of cyber attacks, cyber security has become a major concern for governments and international organizations. In this section, we will explore the role of international law in addressing these threats and promoting cyber security.

#### 7.1a Role of International Law in Cyber Security

International law plays a crucial role in regulating state behavior in the cyber domain. It provides a framework for addressing cyber threats and promoting cooperation among states. The principal global treaty-based legal instrument relating to cyber security is the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, 23 Nov 2001), also known as the Budapest Convention. This convention, overseen by the Council of Europe, has signatories worldwide and provides a global scope for addressing cybercrime.

The Budapest Convention is the first international treaty to address cybercrime and has been ratified by over 60 countries. It aims to harmonize national laws and improve cooperation among countries in investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes. The convention covers a wide range of cybercrimes, including illegal access, interference with data, computer-related fraud, and child pornography. It also includes provisions for international cooperation, such as mutual legal assistance and extradition.

Individual countries also have their own legal requirements relating to lawful interception, which is the process of monitoring and collecting data from electronic communications. For example, in the United Kingdom, the law is known as RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act), while in the United States there is an array of federal and state criminal laws. In Commonwealth of Independent States countries, the law is known as SORM.

In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are other international legal instruments that address cyber security. The United Nations General Assembly has adopted several resolutions on cyber security, including the 2013 resolution on "Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security." This resolution calls for states to cooperate in preventing and responding to cyber attacks and to promote the peaceful use of information and communication technologies.

The European Union has also taken steps to address cyber security through the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive. The EU Cybersecurity Strategy aims to strengthen the EU's resilience to cyber attacks and promote cooperation among member states. The NIS Directive requires member states to adopt national strategies for ensuring the security of their networks and information systems.

In conclusion, international law plays a crucial role in promoting cyber security by providing a framework for addressing cyber threats and promoting cooperation among states. While there are still challenges in effectively enforcing and implementing these laws, they serve as an important foundation for addressing the complex and ever-evolving issue of cyber security in international relations. 

### Subsection: 7.1b Impact of International Law on Cyber Security

The impact of international law on cyber security can be seen in several ways. First, it provides a legal framework for addressing cyber threats and holding perpetrators accountable. This is especially important in cases where cyber attacks originate from one country but target another. International law allows for cooperation and coordination among countries in investigating and prosecuting these crimes.

Second, international law helps to establish norms and standards for responsible state behavior in the cyber domain. This can help prevent conflicts and promote stability in the international system. For example, the Tallinn Manual, a non-binding document produced by a group of international law experts, outlines the applicability of international law to cyber operations and provides guidance on responsible state behavior.

Third, international law can also serve as a deterrent against cyber attacks. The threat of legal consequences can discourage states and non-state actors from engaging in malicious cyber activities. This is particularly relevant in the case of state-sponsored cyber attacks, where international law can be used to hold governments accountable for their actions.

However, there are also challenges in the impact of international law on cyber security. One major challenge is the lack of universal acceptance and enforcement of these laws. Not all countries have ratified the Budapest Convention or adopted similar laws, making it difficult to effectively address cybercrime on a global scale. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancements often outpaces the development of international laws, making it difficult to keep up with emerging cyber threats.

In conclusion, while international law has a significant impact on cyber security, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. As technology continues to evolve, it is important for international laws and norms to adapt and keep pace with these changes in order to effectively promote cyber security in international relations.

In Commonwealth of Independent States countries, the law is known as SORM.

In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are other international legal instruments that play a role in cyber security. These include the United Nations Charter, which prohibits the use of force against other states, and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Constitution, which promotes cooperation and coordination among member states in the field of telecommunications. These instruments provide a framework for addressing cyber threats and promoting cooperation among states.

#### 7.1b Challenges in Applying International Law to Cyber Security

While international law provides a framework for addressing cyber threats, there are challenges in its application to the cyber domain. One of the main challenges is the lack of consensus on what constitutes a cyber attack and how to respond to it. This is due to the evolving nature of cyber threats and the difficulty in attributing attacks to specific actors.

Another challenge is the issue of jurisdiction. With the borderless nature of the internet, it is often difficult to determine which state has jurisdiction over a cyber attack. This can lead to conflicts between states and hinder cooperation in addressing cyber threats.

Additionally, there is a lack of enforcement mechanisms for international cyber laws. Unlike traditional forms of warfare, there is no clear way to enforce international cyber laws and hold states accountable for their actions. This makes it difficult to deter cyber attacks and ensure compliance with international cyber laws.

#### 7.1c Case Studies of International Law in Cyber Security

To better understand the role of international law in cyber security, let us examine some case studies where international law has been applied to address cyber threats.

One notable case is the Stuxnet attack, which targeted Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010. The attack was attributed to the United States and Israel and was considered a violation of international law. However, due to the lack of clear guidelines on cyber warfare, there was no clear legal framework for addressing the attack.

Another case is the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, which affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries. The attack was attributed to North Korea and was considered a violation of international law. However, due to the difficulty in attributing cyber attacks to specific actors, it was challenging to hold North Korea accountable for the attack.

These case studies highlight the challenges in applying international law to cyber security and the need for further development of international cyber laws. As technology continues to advance and cyber threats become more sophisticated, it is crucial for international law to adapt and provide a framework for addressing these threats.


### Section: 7.2 Challenges in Applying International Law to Cyberspace:

The increasing use of technology and the internet has brought about new challenges in the realm of international relations. With the rise of cyber attacks, there has been a growing need for effective cyber security measures. However, applying international law to cyberspace has proven to be a complex and challenging task. In this section, we will explore the current challenges in applying international law to cyberspace.

#### 7.2a Current Challenges in Applying International Law to Cyberspace

One of the main challenges in applying international law to cyberspace is the issue of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is an aspect of state sovereignty and it refers to a state's authority to make and enforce laws within its territory. However, the borderless nature of the internet makes it difficult to determine which state has jurisdiction over cyber activities. This is particularly problematic as the medium of the internet does not explicitly recognize sovereignty and territorial limitations. As a result, there is no uniform, international jurisdictional law of universal application, and such questions are generally a matter of conflict of laws, particularly private international law.

Another challenge is the lack of a comprehensive and universally accepted legal framework for addressing cybercrimes. While the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is a significant step towards international cooperation in combating cybercrimes, it has only been ratified by 60 countries. This leaves a significant number of countries without a legal framework for addressing cybercrimes. Furthermore, the convention does not cover all types of cybercrimes, leaving room for interpretation and potential gaps in enforcement.

Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancements makes it difficult for international law to keep up. As new technologies emerge, they bring about new challenges and threats in the cyber domain. This makes it challenging for international law to adapt and effectively address these issues.

Moreover, there is a lack of consensus among states on how to regulate cyberspace. Some countries advocate for a hands-off approach, arguing that the internet should be self-regulated by the internet community. Others believe that there should be more government involvement in regulating cyberspace. This lack of consensus hinders the development of a comprehensive and effective international legal framework for cyberspace.

In conclusion, applying international law to cyberspace is a complex and challenging task. The borderless nature of the internet, the lack of a comprehensive legal framework, the rapid pace of technological advancements, and the lack of consensus among states all contribute to the challenges in applying international law to cyberspace. As technology continues to advance, it is crucial for international law to adapt and evolve to effectively address the threats and challenges in the cyber domain.

This report also recognized the need for cooperation and collaboration among states to address cyber threats.

However, the evolution of international law in cyberspace has faced challenges. One major challenge is the lack of consensus among states on what constitutes a cyber attack and how to respond to it. This has led to differing interpretations of international law and the potential for conflicting actions by states.

Another challenge is the difficulty in attributing cyber attacks to specific actors or states. This makes it challenging to hold perpetrators accountable and enforce international law in cyberspace.

To address these challenges, there have been efforts to develop norms and rules of behavior in cyberspace. In 2015, the UN GGE released a set of 11 voluntary norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace. These norms include the protection of critical infrastructure, the protection of personal data, and the prevention of cybercrime.

In addition to the UN, other international organizations and initiatives have also played a role in shaping the evolution of international law in cyberspace. For example, the European Union has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect the privacy and personal data of its citizens. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has also developed confidence-building measures to promote transparency and cooperation among states in cyberspace.

#### 7.3b Case Studies of International Law in Cyberspace

To better understand the application of international law in cyberspace, it is helpful to examine case studies of cyber incidents and their legal implications. One such case is the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, which affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries. This attack was attributed to North Korea and raised questions about the use of force in cyberspace and the responsibility of states to prevent cyber attacks originating from their territory.

Another case is the 2016 cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the US presidential election. This attack was attributed to Russia and raised concerns about the interference of foreign actors in domestic elections and the protection of democratic processes in cyberspace.

These case studies highlight the need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to addressing cyber threats and enforcing international law in cyberspace. As technology continues to advance and the use of cyberspace becomes more prevalent in international relations, it is crucial for states to work together to develop and uphold a framework of international law that can effectively address the challenges and threats in cyberspace.


### Section: 7.4 The Role of Non-State Actors in International Law and Cyber Security:

Non-state actors (NSAs) have become increasingly influential in international relations, particularly in the realm of cyber security. These organizations and individuals, which are not affiliated with any government, have diverse interests, structures, and levels of influence. Some common types of NSAs include non-profit organizations, labor unions, non-governmental organizations, corporations, media organizations, and violent non-state actors such as paramilitary forces.

The proliferation of NSAs since the end of the Cold War has challenged the traditional Westphalian state model and led to the Cobweb Paradigm in international politics. This paradigm recognizes the erosion of power and sovereignty of nation-states, with NSAs playing a significant role. Globalization has facilitated the rise of NSAs, which often challenge nation-state borders and sovereignty claims. For example, multinational corporations (MNCs) may prioritize their own interests over national interests, and NSAs advocate for societal issues such as human rights and the environment, challenging a nation-state's sovereignty over internal matters.

In addition to their impact on traditional state sovereignty, NSAs also play a significant role in cyber security and international law. Armed non-state actors, operating without state control, are involved in both internal and trans-border conflicts. Their involvement adds layers of complexity to traditional conflict management and resolution, as these conflicts may not only involve states but also multiple NSA groups. Interventions in such conflicts are particularly challenging, as international law and norms governing the use of force were primarily written in the context of nation-states.

The accountability of armed non-state actors to international law has also become a pressing issue. The United Nations Security Council has recently taken steps to hold NSAs accountable for their actions in cyberspace. In 2015, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2178, which calls on member states to prevent the recruitment and financing of individuals and groups associated with terrorist organizations, including through the use of the internet. This resolution highlights the growing recognition of the role of NSAs in cyber security and the need for international cooperation to address this issue.

The evolution of international law in cyberspace has also been shaped by the involvement of NSAs. In the early days of the internet, there was a belief that it was a space free from government control and regulation. However, as the internet became more integrated into our daily lives, it became clear that there was a need for some form of governance and regulation. The first attempts at creating international law in cyberspace were made in the 1990s, with the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime being the first international treaty to address cybercrimes. However, this convention was limited in scope and only ratified by a small number of countries, limiting its effectiveness.

This has raised questions about the applicability of traditional international law to non-state actors, as well as the need for new laws and regulations to address the unique challenges posed by NSAs in the cyber realm.

#### 7.4b Impact of Non-State Actors on International Law and Cyber Security

The rise of non-state actors has had a significant impact on international law and cyber security. As mentioned earlier, NSAs challenge the traditional Westphalian state model and the concept of state sovereignty. This has led to a shift in the way international law is applied and enforced, as NSAs may not be subject to the same laws and regulations as nation-states.

In the realm of cyber security, NSAs have become a major threat. They have the ability to launch cyber attacks on a global scale, targeting not just nation-states but also private entities and individuals. This has raised questions about the role of international law in addressing cyber attacks by non-state actors. Currently, there is no clear framework for holding NSAs accountable for their actions in cyberspace.

Furthermore, the involvement of NSAs in armed conflicts has added a new dimension to the application of international law. As these conflicts may involve multiple non-state actors, as well as nation-states, it becomes challenging to determine who is responsible for any violations of international law. This has led to debates about the need for new laws and regulations to address the unique challenges posed by NSAs in armed conflicts.

In conclusion, the role of non-state actors in international law and cyber security cannot be ignored. Their increasing influence and involvement in global affairs have challenged traditional concepts and laws, and have raised the need for new approaches to address the unique challenges they pose. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is crucial to find ways to effectively regulate and hold NSAs accountable for their actions in order to maintain peace and stability in the international community.

### Section: 8.1 The Role of Cyber Diplomacy in International Relations:

Cyber diplomacy has become an essential tool for states to engage with each other in the 21st century. It has revolutionized the traditional methods of diplomacy and has opened up new avenues for cooperation and conflict. In this section, we will explore the role of cyber diplomacy in international relations and its impact on state behavior.

#### 8.1a Role of Cyber Diplomacy in International Relations

The concept of cyber diplomacy can be traced back to the early 2000s when the use of digital tools and platforms for diplomatic purposes began to gain traction. As stated by Jan Melissen in "The New Public Diplomacy: Soft Power in International Relations", cyber diplomacy "links the impact of innovations in communication and information technology to diplomacy." It is also known as public diplomacy 2.0, eDiplomacy, and virtual diplomacy.

The United States has been at the forefront of cyber diplomacy, with the Department of State leading its efforts. Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, the mission of American public diplomacy is to support the achievement of U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives, advance national interests, and enhance national security by informing and influencing foreign publics and by expanding and strengthening the relationship between the people and government of the United States and citizens of the rest of the world.

The development of cyber diplomacy by the United States is a response to the changing landscape of international relations.

### Section: 15.4 The Role of Non-State Actors in Cyber Security and Environmental Sustainability:

### Subsection (optional): 15.4a Role of Non-State Actors in Cyber Security and Environmental Sustainability

Non-state actors, such as corporations and NGOs, play a significant role in both cyber security and environmental sustainability. In this subsection, we will explore the ways in which these actors contribute to these two important issues and the challenges they face in doing so.

#### The Role of Non-State Actors in Cyber Security

Non-state actors have become increasingly involved in cyber security, as they are often the targets of cyber attacks and have a vested interest in protecting their own digital assets. These actors include corporations, NGOs, and even individuals who possess valuable information or resources. They play a crucial role in protecting against cyber attacks and mitigating their effects.

One way in which non-state actors contribute to cyber security is through the implementation of self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems. SSI is a technology that allows individuals to have control over their digital identities, reducing the risk of identity theft and other cyber crimes. However, the implementation of SSI can vary significantly and may embed different goals and intentions, leading to semantic confusion. Additionally, SSI assumes a level of digital literacy and access to technology, which may exclude marginalized populations from its benefits.

Another important role of non-state actors in cyber security is through corporate environmental responsibility (CER). As corporations become more aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment, they are implementing strategies to reduce their environmental footprint. This not only benefits the environment, but also helps to protect their digital assets from potential cyber attacks. For example, implementing renewable energy sources and smart grid technologies can reduce a company's reliance on vulnerable energy infrastructure and decrease the risk of cyber attacks on their energy systems.

#### The Role of Non-State Actors in Environmental Sustainability

Non-state actors also play a crucial role in environmental sustainability. As mentioned in the previous section, corporations are increasingly implementing CER strategies to reduce their environmental impact. This is not only driven by stakeholder awareness, but also by the United Nation's sustainable development goals. These goals aim to promote sustainable economic, social, and environmental well-being worldwide, and non-state actors are key players in achieving them.

In addition to corporations, NGOs also play a significant role in environmental sustainability. These organizations often work on the ground to promote conservation and sustainable practices, and they also advocate for policy changes at the international level. For example, NGOs have been instrumental in pushing for the adoption of renewable energy sources and promoting sustainable resource management practices.

However, non-state actors face challenges in their efforts towards environmental sustainability. One major challenge is the lack of regulatory frameworks and enforcement mechanisms for environmental issues. This can make it difficult for non-state actors to hold corporations and governments accountable for their environmental impact. Additionally, non-state actors may face resistance from powerful actors who prioritize economic interests over environmental concerns.

In conclusion, non-state actors play a crucial role in both cyber security and environmental sustainability. Their contributions are essential in addressing these complex and interconnected issues, but they also face challenges in doing so. As technology continues to advance and the global community becomes more aware of the importance of these issues, the role of non-state actors will only become more significant in shaping the future of cyber security and environmental sustainability.

## Chapter 15: Cyber Security and Environmental Sustainability:

### Section: 15.4 The Role of Non-State Actors in Cyber Security and Environmental Sustainability:

### Subsection (optional): 15.4b Impact of Non-State Actors on Cyber Security and Environmental Sustainability

Non-state actors, such as corporations and NGOs, play a significant role in both cyber security and environmental sustainability. In this subsection, we will explore the impact of these actors on these two important issues and the challenges they face in doing so.

#### Impact of Non-State Actors on Cyber Security

Non-state actors have a significant impact on cyber security, as they are often the targets of cyber attacks and have a vested interest in protecting their own digital assets. These actors include corporations, NGOs, and even individuals who possess valuable information or resources. They play a crucial role in protecting against cyber attacks and mitigating their effects.

One of the main impacts of non-state actors on cyber security is through the implementation of self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems. SSI is a technology that allows individuals to have control over their digital identities, reducing the risk of identity theft and other cyber crimes. However, the implementation of SSI can vary significantly and may embed different goals and intentions, leading to semantic confusion. For example, a corporation may implement SSI to protect their customers' personal information, while a government may implement it for surveillance purposes. This can create confusion and mistrust among individuals, as the term "self-sovereign identity" may create expectations of absolute control and ownership over one's digital identity.

Another impact of non-state actors on cyber security is through corporate environmental responsibility (CER). As corporations become more aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment, they are implementing strategies to reduce their environmental footprint. This not only benefits the environment, but also helps to protect their digital assets. For example, implementing sustainable practices such as using renewable energy sources can also reduce the risk of cyber attacks by decreasing the reliance on vulnerable energy systems.

However, the impact of non-state actors on cyber security is not without its challenges. One major challenge is the digital literacy gap. Critics argue that SSI may exacerbate social inequalities and exclude those with limited access to technology or digital literacy. SSI assumes reliable internet connectivity, access to compatible devices, and proficiency in navigating digital systems. Consequently, marginalized populations, including the elderly, individuals in developing regions, or those with limited technological resources, may face exclusion and reduced access to the benefits of SSI.

In addition, the implementation of CER by corporations may also face challenges. While many corporations are taking steps towards sustainability, there are still concerns about greenwashing - the practice of making false or exaggerated claims about environmental responsibility. This can create confusion and mistrust among consumers, making it difficult for them to make informed decisions about which companies to support.

In conclusion, non-state actors have a significant impact on cyber security and environmental sustainability. Their contributions through the implementation of SSI and CER are crucial in protecting digital assets and promoting sustainable practices. However, challenges such as the digital literacy gap and greenwashing must be addressed to ensure that these efforts are inclusive and effective.
