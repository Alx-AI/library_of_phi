# Fracture and Fatigue: A Comprehensive Study":

## Foreward

In the pursuit of understanding the complexities of the human body, we often find ourselves looking beyond the confines of our planet. The unique environment of space provides a distinctive platform to study the physiological effects of microgravity on the human body, particularly on skeletal muscle function. This book, "Fracture and Fatigue: A Comprehensive Study", aims to delve into the intricate details of these effects, drawing from a wealth of research conducted during the Space Shuttle Program (1981–2011).

The Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project (EDOMP), carried out from 1989 to 1995, stands as one of the most comprehensive investigations into skeletal muscle function in space. The project's Detailed Scientific Objectives (DSO) focused on evaluating functional changes in strength and endurance of various muscle groups in astronauts before and after flight. The LIDO® dynamometer, a key tool in these studies, was used to evaluate concentric and eccentric contractions pre and post-flight.

The book will explore the exercise protocols used during these flights, including continuous and interval training, with prescriptions varying from 60% to 85% of preflight maximal oxygen uptake as estimated from heart rate. We will delve into the challenges faced by astronauts in achieving or maintaining their target heart rate during flight, and the innovative solutions developed to overcome these obstacles.

The unique treadmill system used in the Space Shuttle, designed to simulate body weight in a microgravity environment, will also be a focus of our study. We will examine the mechanical and physiological challenges of exercising in space, and how these challenges were met with ingenuity and determination.

This book is not just a study of fractures and fatigue in the human body, but also a testament to human resilience and adaptability in the face of the unknown. It is a comprehensive exploration of the intersection of physiology, engineering, and the relentless human spirit to push the boundaries of our understanding.

As we journey through the chapters of this book, we hope to provide you with a deeper understanding of the physiological effects of space travel on the human body, and inspire you to further explore this fascinating field of study.

## Chapter 1: Mechanics of Fracture

### Introduction

The study of fracture mechanics is a critical aspect of materials science and engineering. It is a field that focuses on the prediction of the conditions under which materials or structural components might fail due to crack growth and fracture. This chapter, "Mechanics of Fracture", aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles and theories that govern the phenomenon of fracture.

Fracture mechanics is a complex field that combines elements of applied mechanics, materials science, and engineering. It is concerned with the study of the initiation, propagation, and arrest of cracks in materials. The understanding of these processes is crucial for predicting the life of structures, preventing catastrophic failures, and designing more durable materials and structures.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of fracture mechanics, starting with the basic definitions and principles. We will explore the different types of fractures, such as brittle and ductile fractures, and their characteristics. We will also discuss the concept of stress intensity factor and its role in predicting the onset and growth of cracks.

We will further explore the theories of fracture mechanics, including the Griffith's theory of brittle fracture and the Irwin's modification for ductile materials. These theories provide a mathematical framework for understanding and predicting fracture behavior. We will also discuss the concept of fracture toughness, a material property that indicates the resistance to fracture.

Finally, we will touch upon the practical applications of fracture mechanics in various fields, including civil engineering, aerospace, and materials science. We will discuss how the principles of fracture mechanics are used to predict the failure of structures and to design materials and structures that are more resistant to fracture.

This chapter will provide a solid foundation for understanding the mechanics of fracture, preparing the reader for the more advanced topics covered in the subsequent chapters. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals in the field of materials science and engineering.

### Section: 1.1 Brittle Fracture

Brittle fracture is a type of fracture that occurs in materials when they break or crack under stress without significant plastic deformation. This type of fracture is characterized by a rapid crack propagation with little to no plastic deformation. Brittle fracture typically occurs in materials with a high hardness and low toughness such as glass, ceramics, and some metals at low temperatures.

#### 1.1a Griffith Theory

The Griffith Theory, proposed by A.A. Griffith in 1921, is a fundamental theory in the field of fracture mechanics. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding the phenomenon of brittle fracture. The theory is based on the concept of energy balance and proposes that a crack will propagate if the decrease in elastic strain energy is greater than the increase in surface energy due to the creation of new crack surfaces.

Griffith's theory can be mathematically expressed as follows:

$$
\sigma_c = \sqrt{\frac{2E\gamma}{\pi a}}
$$

where $\sigma_c$ is the critical stress at which a crack of length $a$ will propagate, $E$ is the Young's modulus of the material, and $\gamma$ is the surface energy per unit area.

This equation shows that the critical stress required for crack propagation decreases as the crack length increases. This is a key insight of Griffith's theory and explains why cracks can propagate rapidly once they reach a certain size, leading to brittle fracture.

Griffith's theory also shows that materials with a high surface energy and Young's modulus are more resistant to brittle fracture. This is because a higher surface energy and Young's modulus increase the critical stress required for crack propagation.

It's important to note that Griffith's theory assumes that the material is homogeneous and isotropic, and that the crack is sharp and perfectly straight. These assumptions are often not met in real materials, which can lead to deviations from the predictions of Griffith's theory. However, despite these limitations, Griffith's theory provides a valuable framework for understanding the fundamental principles of brittle fracture.

#### 1.1b Irwin's Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

Following the Griffith's theory, George R. Irwin further developed the field of fracture mechanics by introducing the concept of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). Irwin's theory is particularly useful for materials that exhibit linear elastic behavior before fracture, which is a common characteristic of many brittle materials.

Irwin introduced the concept of stress intensity factor $K$, which describes the stress field near the tip of a crack. The stress intensity factor is defined as:

$$
K = Y \sigma \sqrt{\pi a}
$$

where $Y$ is a dimensionless factor that depends on the geometry of the crack and the loading conditions, $\sigma$ is the applied stress, and $a$ is the crack length. The stress intensity factor $K$ is a key parameter in LEFM and is used to predict the onset of crack propagation.

Irwin also introduced the concept of fracture toughness $K_c$, which is a material property that describes the resistance of a material to fracture. When the stress intensity factor $K$ reaches the fracture toughness $K_c$, a crack will propagate. This can be expressed as:

$$
K \geq K_c
$$

The fracture toughness $K_c$ is a critical material property in the design of structures and components, as it provides a measure of a material's resistance to fracture.

Irwin's LEFM provides a more general framework for understanding fracture than Griffith's theory, as it can account for the effects of crack tip plasticity and the geometry of the crack and loading conditions. However, like Griffith's theory, LEFM assumes that the material is linear elastic and isotropic, and that the crack is sharp and perfectly straight. These assumptions may not be met in real materials, leading to deviations from the predictions of LEFM.

In the context of computational methods in fracture mechanics, the finite element method can be used to calculate the stress intensity factor $K$ and the J-integral, which is a measure of the energy release rate $G$. These calculations can provide valuable insights into the fracture behavior of materials and structures.

#### 1.1c Crack Propagation Mechanisms

Crack propagation is a critical aspect of fracture mechanics, particularly in brittle materials. The propagation of a crack is governed by the energy release rate, which is the energy available for the extension of the crack. The energy release rate can be calculated using various methods, one of which is the Modified Crack Closure Integral (MCCI).

The MCCI is a method for calculating the energy release rate using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) nodal displacements $u_i^{j}$ and forces $F_i^{j}$. Here, $i$ represents the direction corresponding to the Cartesian basis vectors with origin at the crack tip, and $j$ represents the nodal index. The MCCI is more computationally efficient than the nodal release method as it only requires one analysis for each increment of crack growth.

A necessary condition for the MCCI method is uniform element length $\Delta a$ along the crack face in the $x_1$ direction. This method also requires sufficient discretization such that over the length of one element stress fields are self-similar. This implies that $K(a+\Delta a) \approx K(a)$ as the crack propagates.

##### 4-node elements

Consider a crack with its tip located at node $j$. If the crack were to propagate one element length along the line of symmetry (parallel to the $x_1$-axis), the crack opening displacement would be the displacement at the previous crack tip, i.e., $u^j$, and the force at the new crack tip $(j+1)$. The displacement above and below the crack face respectively is given by $\Delta u_i^{j-1} = u_i^{(+)j-1}-u_i^{(-)j-1}$. Because we have a line of symmetry parallel to the crack, we can assume $u_i^{(+)j-1} = -u_i^{(-)j-1}$. Thus, $\Delta u_i^{j-1} = 2u_i^{(+)j-1}$.

##### 8-node elements

The 8-node rectangular elements are another common type of finite elements used in the MCCI method. The details of crack propagation in 8-node elements will be discussed in the following section.

In conclusion, understanding the mechanisms of crack propagation is crucial in predicting the failure of brittle materials. The MCCI method provides a computationally efficient way to calculate the energy release rate, which is a key parameter in predicting crack propagation. However, it is important to note that the MCCI method, like all computational methods, is based on certain assumptions and may not perfectly represent the complex reality of crack propagation in real materials.
