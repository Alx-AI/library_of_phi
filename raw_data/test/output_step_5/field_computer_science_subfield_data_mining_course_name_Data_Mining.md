# Data Mining: A Comprehensive Guide":

## Foreword

In the rapidly evolving world of data, the traditional methods of data mining are being challenged and expanded upon. The advent of semi-structured data has opened up new avenues for data mining, pushing the boundaries of what we previously thought possible. This book, "Data Mining: A Comprehensive Guide", aims to provide a thorough understanding of these new developments, focusing on the concept of structure mining.

Structure mining, or structured data mining, is a process that involves extracting valuable information from semi-structured data sets. This form of data mining has special cases such as graph mining, sequential pattern mining, and molecule mining. The growth and increased use of semi-structured data have created new opportunities for data mining, which has traditionally been concerned with tabular data sets.

The book will delve into the intricacies of XML, the most common way of representing semi-structured data. XML is capable of representing both tabular data and arbitrary trees, making it a versatile tool in the world of data mining. However, the complexity of XML and the variability of the data it represents present significant challenges for conventional data mining. 

We will explore these challenges in detail, discussing how two messages conforming to the same schema may have little data in common, and how this variability can lead to large sections of tables being empty when trying to format the data as tabular data for conventional data mining. 

This book will also address the assumption often made in the design of most data mining algorithms that the data presented will be complete. In the world of semi-structured data, this assumption is often not valid, and we will explore the implications of this for data mining.

"Data Mining: A Comprehensive Guide" is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of these complex topics. It is written with the advanced undergraduate student in mind, but it will also be of value to anyone interested in the evolving field of data mining. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource in your journey to understand and navigate the world of data mining.
