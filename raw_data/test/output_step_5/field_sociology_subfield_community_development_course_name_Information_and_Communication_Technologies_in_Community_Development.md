# Information and Communication Technologies in Community Development: A Comprehensive Guide":

## Foreword

In the rapidly evolving landscape of the 21st century, the intersection of information and communication technologies (ICTs) with community development has emerged as a critical area of study and practice. This book, "Information and Communication Technologies in Community Development: A Comprehensive Guide", aims to provide a thorough exploration of this complex and multifaceted field, known as community informatics.

Community informatics is a discipline that seeks to understand and enhance the ways in which communities use ICTs to foster development, empowerment, and social change. However, as with any emerging field, it is not without its criticisms and challenges. One of the central tensions lies between the practice and research ends of the field, reflecting a gap that is familiar from other disciplines such as community development, community organizing, and community-based research.

The difficulty that Information Systems has in recognizing the qualitative dimension of technology research means that the kind of approach taken by supporters of community informatics is often difficult to justify to a field oriented towards solutions of technical, rather than social problems. This tension is also seen in the relationship between strict technology research and management research, and in the challenges of conceptualizing and evaluating complex social interventions that rely on a technical base.

This book aims to bridge these gaps, providing a comprehensive overview of the field of community informatics, its theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and the ongoing debates that shape it. Drawing on a wide range of disciplines, from program evaluation and social policy to Management Information Systems, we will explore the relative virtues and values of different forms of research and action, and the ongoing debate over the virtues of allegedly "scientific" or "value-free" activity versus more interpretive and process-driven viewpoints.

In the pages that follow, we will delve into the complexities of community informatics, exploring the ways in which ICTs can be harnessed for community development, the challenges and criticisms that the field faces, and the potential paths forward. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, practitioners, and anyone else interested in the intersection of technology and community development.

Welcome to the journey of understanding and exploring the dynamic field of community informatics.
