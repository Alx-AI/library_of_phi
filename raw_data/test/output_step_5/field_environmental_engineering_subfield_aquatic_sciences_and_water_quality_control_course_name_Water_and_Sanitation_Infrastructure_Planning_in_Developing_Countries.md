# Water and Sanitation Infrastructure Planning in Developing Countries: A Comprehensive Guide":

## Foreward

In the quest for sustainable development, the importance of water and sanitation infrastructure cannot be overstated. This book, "Water and Sanitation Infrastructure Planning in Developing Countries: A Comprehensive Guide", is a comprehensive exploration of the challenges and opportunities that exist in the planning and implementation of water and sanitation infrastructure in developing countries, with a particular focus on Latin America.

The disparities in access to water and sanitation services between rural and urban populations in Latin America are stark. While urban regions often enjoy better services due to greater political recognition, larger populations, and more developed infrastructure, rural communities are often left behind. This book delves into the reasons behind these disparities and offers practical solutions to bridge the gap.

The book also explores the economic implications of water and sanitation services. It is a sad reality that poor households often pay more, in proportional terms, than wealthy households to obtain potable water. This burden is further compounded by the additional costs they incur for medical treatment from drinking contaminated water and the time they spend retrieving water from distant sources.

In light of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) that aimed at halving, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, this book examines the strategies that have been employed to improve services and their effectiveness. It also looks at the role of international organizations like the World Bank in supporting these efforts.

This book is not just a theoretical exploration of the topic. It is a practical guide that offers actionable insights and strategies for policymakers, planners, and practitioners in the field of water and sanitation infrastructure planning. It is our hope that this book will contribute to the ongoing efforts to ensure that everyone, regardless of where they live or their economic status, has access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation services.

The journey towards achieving universal access to water and sanitation is a challenging one, but it is a journey that we must undertake. This book is a step in that direction. We invite you to join us in this important endeavor.
