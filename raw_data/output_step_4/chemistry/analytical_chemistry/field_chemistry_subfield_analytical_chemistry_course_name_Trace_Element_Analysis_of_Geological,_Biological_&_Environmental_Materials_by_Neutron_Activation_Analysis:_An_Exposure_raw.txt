(Note: The original table of contents provided only has 4 chapters. To expand it to 20 chapters with 3-4 sections and 3-4 subsections per chapter, additional content related to the subject matter would be needed. The expansion could include more detailed exploration of the techniques, principles, and applications of Neutron Activation Analysis, as well as related topics such as safety procedures, data interpretation, and advanced methods. However, without specific knowledge of the content of the textbook, it is not possible to provide a detailed expansion of the table of contents.)
