# Computational Design I: Theory and Applications":

## Foreward

In the rapidly evolving world of technology, the field of computational design has emerged as a critical discipline, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications. This book, "Computational Design I: Theory and Applications", is an attempt to provide a comprehensive understanding of the principles and practices that underpin this exciting field.

The book begins by exploring the concept of computer-automated design, a process that leverages the power of computational algorithms to automate the design process. We delve into the theory of exhaustive search, an exponential algorithm that, while theoretically capable of delivering solutions, may not be practical due to time constraints.

Recognizing the limitations of exhaustive search, we then explore the concept of search in polynomial time, a more efficient approach to virtual engineering and automated design. This leads us to the heart of the book: evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Inspired by biological evolution, EAs offer a non-deterministic polynomial algorithm that significantly reduces search time.

We delve into the intricacies of EAs, explaining how they encode design parameters to refine multiple candidates through parallel and interactive search. We discuss the principles of 'selection', 'crossover', and 'mutation', and how these operations contribute to the 'survival of the fittest' learning process. We also explore how EAs can be interfaced with existing CAD simulation packages in a batch mode, and how they can start from a designer's existing design database or from an initial generation of candidate designs obtained randomly.

The book also highlights some of the practical applications of EAs, including websites that demonstrate interactive evolutionary algorithms for design. We discuss platforms like EndlessForms.com and PicBreeder.org, which allow users to evolve 3D objects and 2D images respectively, and have them 3D printed.

Finally, we touch upon the concept of ultra-large-scale systems and the fundamental gaps in our current understanding of software and software development at this scale. This sets the stage for further exploration and research in this field.

"Computational Design I: Theory and Applications" is designed to be a comprehensive guide for advanced undergraduate students, researchers, and professionals in the field. It aims to provide a solid foundation in computational design theory, while also showcasing its practical applications. We hope that this book will inspire you to delve deeper into this fascinating field and contribute to its ongoing evolution.
