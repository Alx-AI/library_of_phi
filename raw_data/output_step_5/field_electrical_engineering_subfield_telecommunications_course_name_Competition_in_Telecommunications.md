# Competition in Telecommunications: A Comprehensive Guide":

## Foreward

In the rapidly evolving world of telecommunications, the landscape of competition is constantly shifting. The advent of digitization has brought about significant changes in the way businesses operate and compete, particularly in the realm of telecommunications. This book, "Competition in Telecommunications: A Comprehensive Guide", aims to provide a thorough understanding of these changes and their implications for competition in the sector.

The rise of platforms and online marketplaces has been a defining feature of the digital age. These platforms, as defined by Bresnahan and Greenstein (1999), are "a reconfigurable base of compatible components on which users build applications". They are characterized by their technical standards, including hardware specifications and software standards. The strategies these platforms employ in terms of pricing and product offerings differ significantly from those of traditional firms, largely due to the presence of network effects.

Network effects, where the utility of a platform increases with the number of its users, have a profound impact on competition. The ability of online platforms to replicate processes or algorithms at virtually no cost allows them to scale these network effects without encountering diminishing returns. This phenomenon complicates the analysis of competition between platforms, making it a more intricate process than analyzing competition between traditional firms.

A key question that arises in this context is whether online platforms tend towards "winner-takes-all" outcomes, and if so, whether they should be subject to antitrust actions. This book delves into these issues, providing a comprehensive analysis of the competitive dynamics in the telecommunications industry.

Online platforms have also significantly reduced transaction costs, particularly in markets where the quality of a good or trading partner is uncertain. Examples of this include eBay, which revolutionized the market for used consumer goods by providing a search engine and reputation system, and Airbnb, which did the same for accommodations. Economists are keenly interested in quantifying the gains from these marketplaces and studying how they should be designed.

"Competition in Telecommunications: A Comprehensive Guide" aims to provide readers with a deep understanding of these complex issues. It is designed to be accessible to advanced undergraduate students, while also providing valuable insights for industry professionals and policymakers. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in the economics of digitization and competition in the telecommunications industry.
