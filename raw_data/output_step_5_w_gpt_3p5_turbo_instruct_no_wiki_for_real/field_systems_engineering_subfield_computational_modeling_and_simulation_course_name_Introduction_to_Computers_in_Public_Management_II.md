Analytic mapping is a technique used to visualize and analyze data related to crime patterns and trends. It involves the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical analysis to map and identify crime hotspots, patterns, and trends.

#### 2.1a Introduction to Analytic Mapping

Analytic mapping has become an essential tool in crime management, as it allows for a more data-driven and evidence-based approach to understanding and addressing crime. By utilizing GIS technology, crime data can be mapped and analyzed in a spatial context, providing valuable insights into the distribution and concentration of crime in a particular area.

The use of computers in analytic mapping has greatly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of crime analysis. In the past, crime data was manually collected and analyzed, which was a time-consuming and error-prone process. With the use of computers, crime data can now be collected and analyzed in real-time, allowing for a more timely and accurate response to crime.

One of the key benefits of analytic mapping is its ability to identify crime hotspots. By analyzing crime data in a spatial context, patterns and trends can be identified, and resources can be allocated to areas with the highest concentration of crime. This targeted approach has been proven to be more effective in reducing crime rates compared to traditional methods.

Analytic mapping also allows for the identification of crime patterns and trends over time. By analyzing historical crime data, patterns and trends can be identified, and predictive models can be developed to forecast future crime trends. This information can be used to inform crime prevention strategies and resource allocation.

### Section: 2.3 Simple Queries on a Database:

In order to effectively analyze crime data, it is important to be able to retrieve specific information from a database. This is where simple queries come in. A query is a request for information from a database, and it allows us to select specific fields and records that meet certain criteria.

#### Subsection: 2.3a Selecting Fields and Records

When creating a query, we can specify which fields we want to retrieve from the database. This allows us to focus on the specific information that is relevant to our analysis. For example, if we are interested in the location and type of crime, we can select the "location" and "crime type" fields from the database.

In addition to selecting fields, we can also specify which records we want to retrieve. This allows us to filter the data based on certain criteria. For example, we can retrieve only the records for a specific time period or a specific location.

To create a query, we use a structured query language (SQL) which allows us to specify the fields and records we want to retrieve. The syntax for a simple query is as follows:

```
SELECT [fields]
FROM [table]
WHERE [conditions];
```

The "SELECT" statement specifies which fields we want to retrieve, the "FROM" statement specifies which table we want to retrieve the data from, and the "WHERE" statement allows us to specify the conditions for filtering the data.

For example, if we want to retrieve the location and crime type for all records in the month of January, our query would look like this:

```
SELECT location, crime_type
FROM crime_data
WHERE month = 'January';
```

This query would return a table with the location and crime type for all crimes that occurred in the month of January.

In addition to simple queries, we can also use more complex queries to retrieve information from multiple tables or to perform calculations on the data. However, understanding how to create and use simple queries is essential for effectively analyzing crime data.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use the data retrieved from a database to create analytic maps and identify crime patterns.

For example, if we want to retrieve the location and crime type for all records in the month of January, our query would look like this:

```
SELECT location, crime_type
FROM crime_data
WHERE month = 'January';
```

#### Subsection: 2.3b Simple Aggregation

In addition to selecting specific fields and records, we can also use simple queries to perform aggregation on our data. Aggregation is the process of summarizing data by grouping it into categories and calculating statistics such as counts, averages, and sums.

To perform aggregation, we use the "GROUP BY" statement in our query. This allows us to group our data by a specific field and then calculate statistics for each group. For example, if we want to calculate the total number of crimes for each location, our query would look like this:

```
SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS total_crimes
FROM crime_data
GROUP BY location;
```

This would give us a table with two columns: "location" and "total_crimes", where each row represents a different location and the corresponding total number of crimes.

In addition to the "GROUP BY" statement, we can also use the "HAVING" statement to further filter our aggregated data. This allows us to specify conditions for the aggregated data, similar to the "WHERE" statement in a simple query.

For example, if we only want to see locations with more than 100 crimes, our query would look like this:

```
SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS total_crimes
FROM crime_data
GROUP BY location
HAVING total_crimes > 100;
```

This would give us a table with only the locations that have more than 100 crimes.

In conclusion, simple queries and aggregation are powerful tools for retrieving and summarizing data from a database. They allow us to focus on specific information and gain insights from our data, which is crucial in crime analysis and management.

#### Subsection: 4.2a Query Design

Before we dive into the technical aspects of creating a query, it is important to understand the design process. A well-designed query can save time and effort in retrieving the desired data. The following steps can help in designing an effective query:

1. Identify the purpose of the query: The first step in query design is to clearly define the purpose of the query. This will help in determining the specific data that needs to be retrieved.

2. Determine the data source: Once the purpose is identified, the next step is to determine the data source. This could be a specific table or multiple tables in a database.

3. Select the fields: After identifying the data source, the next step is to select the fields that are needed for the query. This will depend on the purpose of the query and the data source.

4. Define the criteria: Criteria are conditions that must be met for the data to be retrieved. This could include specific values, ranges, or patterns.

5. Test the query: Before running the query, it is important to test it to ensure that it is retrieving the desired data. This can help in identifying any errors or issues that need to be addressed.

Once these steps are completed, the query can be executed and the desired data can be retrieved. It is important to note that the design process may vary depending on the database management system being used. However, these basic steps can be applied to most databases.

Now that we have discussed the design process, let's take a closer look at the technical aspects of creating a simple query.

#### Subsection: 4.2b Query Language

The most common way to create a query is through the use of a query language. A query language is a specialized programming language used to retrieve data from a database. The most widely used query language is Structured Query Language (SQL).

SQL allows users to write queries in a simple and intuitive manner. It uses keywords and commands to specify the data to be retrieved and the criteria to be met. For example, the following SQL query retrieves the names of all employees from the "Employees" table:

```
SELECT Name FROM Employees;
```

This query uses the "SELECT" keyword to specify the fields to be retrieved, followed by the field name "Name" and the table name "Employees". This query will return a list of all employee names from the "Employees" table.

SQL also allows for the use of operators such as "WHERE" and "AND" to specify criteria. For example, the following query retrieves the names of all employees who have a salary greater than $50,000:

```
SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000;
```

This query uses the "WHERE" keyword to specify the criteria, followed by the field name "Salary", the operator ">", and the value "50000". This query will return a list of all employee names who meet the specified criteria.

#### Subsection: 4.2c Query Design Tools

While SQL is the most commonly used query language, there are also various query design tools available that provide a graphical user interface for creating queries. These tools allow users to visually design a query by selecting fields, specifying criteria, and running the query.

Some popular query design tools include Microsoft Access, MySQL Workbench, and Oracle SQL Developer. These tools are user-friendly and can be helpful for those who are not familiar with SQL or prefer a more visual approach to query design.

In conclusion, simple queries are an essential tool for retrieving specific data from a database. By following a well-defined design process and using a query language or design tool, users can easily retrieve the desired data and gain valuable insights for decision making in public management.

### Subsection: 7.1a Advanced Query Design

In this subsection, we will focus on advanced query design, which is a crucial skill for public managers to have in order to effectively retrieve specific data from databases. A query is a request for data from a database, and it is written in a programming language called SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating data in relational databases.

#### Data Normalization

Before we dive into advanced query design, it is important to understand the concept of data normalization. Data normalization is the process of organizing a database in a way that reduces redundancy and dependency. This results in a more efficient and accurate database, as well as easier data retrieval. There are several levels of data normalization, with each level building upon the previous one. The most commonly used level is the third normal form (3NF), which ensures that all data is stored in its most logical and efficient form.

#### Advanced Query Writing

Now that we have a basic understanding of data normalization, let's explore how to write advanced queries in SQL. Advanced queries allow for more complex data retrieval, such as retrieving data from multiple tables or using conditions to filter data. Let's look at an example of an advanced query:

```
SELECT employee_name, department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id
WHERE salary > 50000
```

In this query, we are retrieving the names of employees and their corresponding department names from two different tables, employees and departments. The INNER JOIN clause allows us to combine data from both tables based on a common column, in this case, the department ID. The WHERE clause allows us to filter the data based on a condition, in this case, a salary greater than 50000.

#### Joins and Subqueries

Joins and subqueries are two important concepts in advanced query design. Joins allow us to combine data from multiple tables, as seen in the example above. Subqueries, on the other hand, are queries within a query. They allow us to retrieve data based on the results of another query. Let's look at an example of a subquery:

```
SELECT employee_name, department_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE location = 'Boston')
```

In this query, we are retrieving the names of employees and their corresponding department names from the employees table, but only for employees who work in the Boston location. The subquery is used to retrieve the department IDs for the Boston location from the departments table.

#### Conclusion

In this subsection, we have explored the concept of data normalization and how it improves the efficiency and accuracy of databases. We have also learned about advanced query design and how to write complex queries using SQL. Joins and subqueries are important tools in advanced query design, allowing us to retrieve data from multiple tables and filter data based on specific conditions.
