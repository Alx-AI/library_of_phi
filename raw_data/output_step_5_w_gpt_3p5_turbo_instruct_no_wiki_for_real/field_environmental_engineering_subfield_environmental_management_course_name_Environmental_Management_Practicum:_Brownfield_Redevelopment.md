## Foreward

Welcome to "Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment", a comprehensive guide to understanding and navigating the complex world of brownfield redevelopment. As the title suggests, this book is a practical resource for those interested in the environmental management of brownfield sites, with a focus on the process of revitalization and redevelopment.

The concept of brownfield redevelopment has gained significant attention in recent years, as communities and governments around the world grapple with the challenges of urbanization and industrialization. Brownfield sites, defined as "a previously developed land that may be contaminated and has the potential for reuse", are a common occurrence in many cities and towns. These sites often pose a threat to human health and the environment, and their presence can hinder economic growth and community development.

Fortunately, with the passing of the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, there is now a framework in place to address these issues and promote the revitalization of brownfield sites. This act requires landowners to conduct an "all appropriate inquiry" and take necessary steps to protect human health and the environment before redeveloping a brownfield site. It also provides funding for brownfield assessment, cleanup, and job training, as well as promoting public-private partnerships to turn these sites into valuable economic and environmental assets.

In this book, we will explore the various aspects of brownfield redevelopment, from the legal and regulatory requirements to the funding opportunities and community engagement strategies. We will also examine case studies from around the world, including a detailed look at the successful redevelopment of brownfield sites in Canada.

I would like to thank the Environmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Program for their collaboration and support in the creation of this book. I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of our team of experts and researchers who have provided valuable insights and information.

I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, professionals, and anyone interested in the field of environmental management and brownfield redevelopment. Let us work together to turn these once-contaminated sites into thriving and sustainable spaces for our communities.

### Section: 2.1 Definition and Overview:

Brownfield redevelopment is the process of revitalizing contaminated or underutilized land for new development. This land may have been previously used for industrial or commercial purposes, and may have been abandoned or left vacant due to contamination or other environmental concerns. Brownfield redevelopment involves the assessment, remediation, and redevelopment of these sites to make them suitable for new uses, such as residential, commercial, or recreational purposes.

#### 2.1a Definition of Brownfield

The term "brownfield" was first used in the United States in the 1970s to describe abandoned or underutilized industrial sites. However, the definition of brownfield has evolved over time and can vary depending on the context and jurisdiction. In general, brownfields are defined as properties that are abandoned, idled, or underutilized due to real or perceived environmental contamination. This contamination may be caused by past industrial or commercial activities, such as manufacturing, mining, or waste disposal.

The definition of brownfield also includes properties that are perceived to be contaminated, even if there is no evidence of actual contamination. This is known as a "perceived brownfield" and can occur when there is a stigma attached to a property due to its past use or location. Perceived brownfields can be just as challenging to redevelop as actual brownfields, as they may face similar regulatory and financial barriers.

In addition to contamination, brownfields may also have other characteristics that make them challenging to redevelop, such as outdated infrastructure, lack of access to transportation, or incompatible land use patterns. These factors can make it difficult to attract developers and investors to these sites, further hindering their redevelopment.

Overall, the definition of brownfield is broad and encompasses a range of properties that may have different levels of contamination and challenges associated with their redevelopment. However, the common thread among all brownfields is the need for environmental management to address the contamination and facilitate their reuse.

### Section: 6.1 Overview of Financing Options:

In this section, we will provide an overview of the various financing options available for brownfield redevelopment. These options can be broadly categorized into two types: public financing and private financing.

#### Subsection: 6.1a Public Financing Options

Public financing options for brownfield redevelopment include grants, loans, and tax incentives. These options are typically provided by government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.

Grants are a form of financial assistance that does not need to be repaid. They are often provided by government agencies to support specific projects or activities that align with their goals and objectives. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, grants can be used to cover the costs of site assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment.

Loans, on the other hand, are a form of financial assistance that must be repaid with interest. They can be obtained from government agencies or private lenders and can be used to cover the costs of brownfield redevelopment. Loans may have more favorable terms and interest rates compared to traditional loans, making them a more attractive option for developers.

Tax incentives are another form of public financing that can be used to support brownfield redevelopment. These incentives can take the form of tax credits, exemptions, or deductions, and can help offset the costs of cleanup and redevelopment. They are often provided by government agencies to encourage private investment in brownfield sites.

#### Subsection: 6.1b Private Financing Options

Private financing options for brownfield redevelopment include traditional loans, equity investments, and public-private partnerships. These options are provided by private lenders and investors, and can be used to cover the costs of brownfield redevelopment.

Traditional loans are loans obtained from private lenders, such as banks or credit unions. They typically have higher interest rates and stricter repayment terms compared to loans obtained from government agencies. However, they can still be a viable option for developers who are unable to secure public financing.

Equity investments involve selling a portion of ownership in a project to investors in exchange for funding. This can be a more attractive option for developers who are unable to obtain loans or grants, as it does not require repayment. However, it also means sharing ownership and potential profits with investors.

Brownfield redevelopment projects have the potential to bring numerous benefits to a community, including economic growth, job creation, and improved environmental conditions. However, it is important to also consider the potential social impacts of these projects. In this section, we will discuss the various ways in which brownfield redevelopment can affect social equity.

#### 12.1a Overview of Social Impacts

Before delving into the specific social impacts of brownfield redevelopment, it is important to define the concept of social equity. Social equity refers to the fair distribution of resources, opportunities, and privileges among all members of a society. This includes access to education, healthcare, housing, and employment, among other things. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, social equity means ensuring that all members of a community, regardless of their socioeconomic status or race, have equal access to the benefits and opportunities that come with these projects.

One of the main social impacts of brownfield redevelopment is the potential displacement of low-income and minority communities. As brownfield sites are often located in economically disadvantaged areas, the redevelopment of these sites can lead to gentrification and rising property values, making it difficult for long-time residents to afford to stay in their homes. This can result in the displacement of these communities, leading to a loss of social ties and community cohesion.

Furthermore, brownfield redevelopment can also have a negative impact on the health and well-being of residents in the surrounding area. The remediation process can release harmful pollutants into the air and water, potentially causing health issues for nearby residents.

In order to address these social impacts, it is crucial to involve the community in the brownfield redevelopment process. Community engagement can help to ensure that the needs and concerns of residents are taken into consideration and that the benefits of the project are shared equitably. This can include involving community members in decision-making processes, providing opportunities for job training and employment, and incorporating affordable housing into the redevelopment plans.

In addition to community engagement, there are various strategies and tools that can be used to promote social equity in brownfield redevelopment projects. These may include affordable housing requirements, which can help to ensure that new developments include affordable units for low-income residents. Job training programs can also be implemented to provide employment opportunities for local residents, particularly those who may have been displaced by the redevelopment. Community benefits agreements, which are contracts between developers and community organizations, can also be used to ensure that the benefits of the project are shared with the community.

However, implementing these strategies can also present challenges. For example, affordable housing requirements may be met with resistance from developers who argue that it will increase the cost of the project. Job training programs may also face challenges in finding suitable employment opportunities for participants. It is important to address these challenges and find solutions that balance the needs of all stakeholders involved.

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment has the potential to bring numerous benefits to a community, but it is important to consider the potential social impacts of these projects. By promoting social equity and involving the community in the redevelopment process, we can ensure that these projects not only benefit the environment and economy, but also the well-being of all members of the community.

To further illustrate the importance of social equity in brownfield redevelopment, let's take a look at some case studies.

One example is the redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Baltimore, Maryland. This site was once a major source of employment for the surrounding community, but after its closure in 2012, it became a brownfield site. The redevelopment project, led by the community and local government, focused on creating job opportunities for the local residents, many of whom were low-income and minority individuals. This not only provided economic benefits, but also helped to preserve the social fabric of the community.

Another case study is the redevelopment of the former Cabrini-Green public housing project in Chicago, Illinois. This project was known for its high levels of poverty and crime, and its demolition in the early 2000s displaced many low-income and minority families. However, the redevelopment project aimed to create a mixed-income community, with affordable housing options for low-income residents. This not only provided housing opportunities for those who were displaced, but also helped to create a more diverse and inclusive community.

These case studies demonstrate the importance of considering social equity in brownfield redevelopment projects. By prioritizing the needs and concerns of the community, these projects can not only bring economic and environmental benefits, but also promote social equity and inclusivity. 


### Section: 12.2 Social Equity Strategies:

Brownfield redevelopment projects have the potential to bring numerous benefits to a community, including economic growth, job creation, and improved environmental conditions. However, it is important to also consider the potential social impacts of these projects. In this section, we will discuss strategies for promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 12.2a Overview of Social Equity Strategies

Before delving into specific strategies, it is important to understand the underlying principles of promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment.

This can help create job opportunities for members of the community who may have been negatively impacted by the brownfield site in the past. Additionally, developers can work with local organizations to provide job training programs and apprenticeships to help prepare community members for these job opportunities.

In order to address potential displacement of low-income and minority communities, developers can also incorporate affordable housing into the redevelopment project. This can help ensure that residents are not forced to leave their homes due to rising property values. In addition, developers can work with community organizations to provide relocation assistance and support for those who may be displaced.

To mitigate potential health impacts on nearby residents, developers can implement measures to reduce pollution during the remediation and construction process. This can include using environmentally-friendly remediation techniques and implementing green building practices for new developments. Additionally, developers can work with community organizations to monitor air and water quality during and after the project to ensure that the health of residents is not compromised.

Overall, promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment requires a collaborative effort between developers, community organizations, and local government. By incorporating these strategies and principles, brownfield redevelopment projects can not only bring economic and environmental benefits, but also promote social equity and improve the overall well-being of the community.


### Section: 12.2 Social Equity Strategies:

Brownfield redevelopment projects have the potential to bring numerous benefits to a community, including economic growth, job creation, and improved environmental conditions. However, it is important to also consider the potential social impacts of these projects. In this section, we will discuss strategies for promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 12.2a Overview of Social Equity Strategies

Before delving into specific strategies, it is important to understand the underlying principles of promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment. These principles include community involvement, transparency, and accountability. By involving community members in the decision-making process and being transparent about the goals and potential impacts of the project, developers can ensure that the needs and concerns of all stakeholders are taken into account. Additionally, holding developers accountable for meeting social equity goals can help ensure that the benefits of brownfield redevelopment are distributed fairly among all members of the community.

One strategy for promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment is through the use of community benefits agreements (CBAs). CBAs are legally binding agreements between developers and community organizations that outline specific benefits and commitments that the developer will provide to the community in exchange for their support of the project. These benefits can include affordable housing, job training programs, and environmental remediation efforts. By involving community organizations in the negotiation process, CBAs can help ensure that the needs and concerns of the community are addressed and that the benefits of the project are distributed equitably.

Another strategy is to prioritize the hiring of local residents and minority-owned businesses for the construction and operation of the redevelopment project. This can help create job opportunities for those who may have been disproportionately impacted by the presence of the brownfield site. Additionally, providing job training programs and apprenticeships can help build skills and create a more diverse and inclusive workforce.

#### 12.2b Selection of Social Equity Strategies

When selecting social equity strategies for a brownfield redevelopment project, it is important to consider the specific needs and concerns of the community. This can be done through community engagement and needs assessments. By involving community members in the decision-making process, developers can gain a better understanding of the social issues that are most important to the community and tailor their strategies accordingly.

Another factor to consider is the feasibility and effectiveness of different strategies. Some strategies, such as CBAs, may require significant resources and negotiation, while others, such as prioritizing local hiring, may be more easily implemented. It is important to weigh the potential impact and cost of each strategy in order to select the most appropriate ones for the specific project.

In addition, it is important to continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of social equity strategies throughout the project. This can help identify any issues or areas for improvement and allow for adjustments to be made in a timely manner. By regularly communicating with the community and being transparent about the progress of social equity goals, developers can build trust and ensure that the benefits of the project are being distributed fairly.

In conclusion, promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment requires a combination of principles, strategies, and continuous evaluation. By involving the community, being transparent and accountable, and selecting appropriate strategies, developers can help ensure that the benefits of brownfield redevelopment are shared equitably among all members of the community.

## Chapter: Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment

### Introduction:

In this chapter, we will be discussing the topic of brownfield redevelopment and its relationship with environmental justice. Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that are potentially contaminated with hazardous substances. These properties are often located in economically disadvantaged areas, leading to a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. Brownfield redevelopment aims to revitalize these properties and turn them into productive and safe spaces for the community.

The process of brownfield redevelopment involves various stakeholders, including government agencies, developers, and community members. It requires careful planning and consideration of environmental, social, and economic factors. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on incorporating principles of environmental justice into brownfield redevelopment projects. This involves addressing the unequal distribution of environmental burdens and benefits among different communities.

In this chapter, we will explore the history of brownfield redevelopment and its evolution towards a more equitable and sustainable approach. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with incorporating environmental justice into brownfield redevelopment projects. Additionally, we will examine case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have prioritized environmental justice. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the importance of considering environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment and the potential benefits it can bring to communities.


### Section: 13.1 Environmental Justice and Brownfields:

Environmental justice is a concept that recognizes the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on marginalized communities, particularly low-income and minority populations. These communities often bear a higher burden of environmental pollution and its associated health risks, while also having less access to resources and decision-making power to address these issues. This intersection of environmental and social inequality is especially evident in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

#### 13.1a Definition of Environmental Justice

The term "environmental justice" was first coined in the 1980s by civil rights activists who were fighting against the placement of hazardous waste facilities in low-income and minority neighborhoods. It has since evolved to encompass a broader understanding of the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and burdens. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as "the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies." This definition highlights the importance of not only addressing existing environmental injustices but also involving all communities in decision-making processes to prevent future disparities.

Environmental justice is closely linked to the concept of equity, which recognizes that different communities have different needs and resources and therefore require different levels of support to achieve equal outcomes. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this means considering the unique challenges and opportunities faced by marginalized communities and ensuring that they are not further disadvantaged by the redevelopment process.

One of the key principles of environmental justice is the "polluter pays" principle, which holds that those responsible for environmental pollution should bear the costs of cleanup and remediation. This principle is particularly relevant in the context of brownfield redevelopment, as it shifts the burden of addressing contamination from the affected community to the responsible parties. It also serves as a deterrent for future environmental violations and promotes accountability for environmental harm.

In addition to the "polluter pays" principle, environmental justice also emphasizes the importance of community involvement and empowerment. This means engaging with community members and stakeholders throughout the brownfield redevelopment process, from site assessment and cleanup to redevelopment and ongoing maintenance. By involving the community in decision-making and providing them with the necessary resources and information, environmental justice can help to build trust and promote more equitable outcomes.

Overall, the concept of environmental justice is crucial in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It recognizes the historical and ongoing impacts of environmental injustices on marginalized communities and seeks to address these disparities through equitable and inclusive approaches. In the following sections, we will explore how environmental justice has been incorporated into brownfield redevelopment projects and the challenges and opportunities associated with this integration.

One of the key principles of environmental justice is the "polluter pays" principle, which holds that those responsible for environmental pollution should bear the costs of remediation and cleanup. This principle is especially relevant in the context of brownfield redevelopment, as the responsibility for addressing contamination often falls on the property owners or developers seeking to redevelop the site. However, this can create a barrier for marginalized communities who may not have the financial resources to take on such projects. Therefore, it is important for environmental justice to be considered in the planning and funding of brownfield redevelopment projects to ensure that the burden of cleanup and redevelopment is not unfairly placed on already disadvantaged communities.

#### 13.1b Role of Environmental Justice in Brownfield Redevelopment

Environmental justice plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment by addressing the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and burdens and promoting equitable outcomes for all communities. This includes not only addressing existing environmental injustices but also involving marginalized communities in decision-making processes and ensuring that they have access to resources and support to participate in the redevelopment process.

One way in which environmental justice can be incorporated into brownfield redevelopment is through community engagement and participation. This involves actively involving community members in the planning and decision-making processes for brownfield redevelopment projects. By including the perspectives and needs of marginalized communities, the redevelopment process can be more responsive to their concerns and ensure that their voices are heard.

Another important aspect of environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment is the consideration of equity in the distribution of benefits and costs. This means taking into account the unique challenges and opportunities faced by marginalized communities and ensuring that they are not further disadvantaged by the redevelopment process. This can include providing financial assistance or incentives for community involvement and ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment, such as job opportunities and improved environmental conditions, are equitably distributed among all community members.

In conclusion, environmental justice is a crucial aspect of brownfield redevelopment that aims to address the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and burdens and promote equitable outcomes for all communities. By incorporating environmental justice principles into the planning and implementation of brownfield redevelopment projects, we can ensure that marginalized communities are not further disadvantaged and that the redevelopment process is inclusive and responsive to their needs.

One of the key principles of environmental justice is the "polluter pays" principle, which holds that those responsible for environmental pollution should bear the costs of remediation and cleanup. This principle is especially relevant in the context of brownfield redevelopment, as these sites are often contaminated due to past industrial activities. In many cases, the companies responsible for the contamination have long since gone bankrupt or are no longer in operation, leaving the burden of cleanup on the local community or government. This further exacerbates the environmental injustice faced by marginalized communities, as they are left to deal with the consequences of pollution caused by others.

#### 13.1b Environmental Justice and Brownfield Redevelopment

Brownfield redevelopment presents a unique opportunity to address environmental justice concerns. These sites, which are often located in economically disadvantaged areas, can be transformed into productive and sustainable spaces that benefit the local community. However, this redevelopment must be done in a way that prioritizes the needs and concerns of the community and ensures that they are not further marginalized in the process.

One approach to achieving environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment is through community engagement and participation. This involves actively involving community members in the decision-making process and incorporating their input and concerns into the redevelopment plans. This not only ensures that the needs of the community are addressed, but also empowers them to take ownership of the redevelopment and its outcomes.

#### 13.1c Case Studies in Environmental Justice and Brownfield Redevelopment

There have been numerous successful case studies of environmental justice and brownfield redevelopment in the United States. One example is the redevelopment of the South Bronx in New York City. This area was once a hub of industrial activity, but as industries moved out, it became a heavily polluted and economically disadvantaged community. Through community engagement and partnerships with local organizations, the South Bronx has been transformed into a thriving community with green spaces, affordable housing, and sustainable businesses.

Another example is the redevelopment of the former Pullman railcar manufacturing site in Chicago. This site was contaminated with heavy metals and other pollutants, and its redevelopment was a collaborative effort between the community, government agencies, and private developers. The resulting mixed-use development includes affordable housing, a community center, and a park, providing much-needed resources and opportunities for the local community.

These case studies demonstrate the potential for brownfield redevelopment to not only address environmental justice concerns, but also to revitalize and empower marginalized communities. However, it is important to note that each community and brownfield site is unique, and successful redevelopment requires a tailored approach that takes into account the specific needs and concerns of the community. 


### Section: 13.2 Environmental Justice Strategies:

Environmental justice strategies are approaches and actions that aim to address and mitigate the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on marginalized communities. These strategies are crucial in the context of brownfield redevelopment, as these communities often face additional challenges and barriers in the process of revitalizing contaminated sites.

#### 13.2a Overview of Environmental Justice Strategies

There are various environmental justice strategies that can be implemented in the context of brownfield redevelopment. These strategies can be broadly categorized into three main areas: community engagement and empowerment, equitable distribution of benefits, and environmental justice policies and regulations.

One of the key strategies for addressing environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment is community engagement and empowerment. This involves actively involving and empowering marginalized communities in the decision-making process of brownfield redevelopment projects. This can include providing opportunities for community input and participation in the planning and design of redevelopment projects, as well as ensuring that community members have access to information and resources to effectively engage in the process.

Equitable distribution of benefits is another important strategy in addressing environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment. This involves ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment, such as job opportunities and improved environmental conditions, are distributed fairly among all members of the community, including marginalized groups. This can be achieved through targeted hiring and training programs, as well as community benefit agreements that outline specific benefits for the affected community.

Environmental justice policies and regulations also play a crucial role in addressing environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment. These policies and regulations can include measures to prevent the placement of hazardous facilities in marginalized communities, as well as requirements for community involvement and equitable distribution of benefits in redevelopment projects. The EPA's Environmental Justice Small Grants Program is an example of a policy that provides funding for community-based organizations to address environmental and public health issues in their communities.

Overall, a combination of these strategies is necessary to effectively address environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment. By actively engaging and empowering marginalized communities, ensuring equitable distribution of benefits, and implementing policies and regulations that promote environmental justice, we can work towards creating more just and sustainable communities.

## Chapter: Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment

### Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing concern for the environment and the impact of human activities on it. One of the major issues that has gained attention is the redevelopment of brownfields, which are abandoned or underutilized properties that may be contaminated with hazardous substances. These properties pose a threat to public health and the environment, and their redevelopment is crucial for sustainable land use and economic growth.

In this chapter, we will focus on the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation. Brownfield redevelopment often involves the reuse of existing structures, some of which may have historical significance. This presents a unique challenge as developers must balance the need for environmental remediation with the preservation of historical structures. We will explore the various approaches and strategies that can be used to successfully integrate brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation.

We will also discuss the regulatory framework for brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation, including federal and state laws and programs. This includes the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, which provides funding for the cleanup of contaminated sites. We will also examine the role of local governments and community organizations in promoting and facilitating brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation.

Finally, we will highlight case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have incorporated historic preservation. These examples will demonstrate the potential benefits of this approach, including economic revitalization, environmental remediation, and preservation of cultural heritage. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities involved in the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation. 


### Section: 17.1 Historic Preservation and Brownfields:

Historic preservation is the practice of protecting and preserving buildings, structures, objects, and sites that have historical, cultural, or architectural significance. This can include buildings that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as structures that are considered important to the local community. The goal of historic preservation is to maintain the integrity and character of these structures while also ensuring their continued use and enjoyment by future generations.

Historic preservation is closely linked to brownfield redevelopment, as many brownfield sites contain historical structures that are in need of remediation and reuse. However, the integration of these two processes can be challenging, as they often have conflicting goals. Brownfield redevelopment focuses on the cleanup and reuse of contaminated sites, while historic preservation aims to protect and maintain the historical significance of structures. Therefore, it is important to find a balance between these two objectives in order to successfully integrate them.

One approach to achieving this balance is through adaptive reuse, which involves repurposing existing structures for a new use while preserving their historical features. This can be a cost-effective and sustainable way to incorporate historic preservation into brownfield redevelopment. Another strategy is to carefully plan and design the redevelopment project in a way that minimizes the impact on historical structures. This may involve conducting thorough environmental assessments and implementing remediation techniques that are less invasive to the existing structures.

In addition to the physical challenges of integrating historic preservation into brownfield redevelopment, there are also regulatory considerations. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their actions on historic properties. This includes brownfield redevelopment projects that receive federal funding or require federal permits. State and local governments may also have their own laws and regulations regarding historic preservation and brownfield redevelopment.

Overall, the successful integration of historic preservation and brownfield redevelopment requires careful planning, collaboration, and consideration of both environmental and cultural factors. By finding a balance between these two processes, we can not only revitalize contaminated sites but also preserve the historical character and cultural heritage of our communities.
