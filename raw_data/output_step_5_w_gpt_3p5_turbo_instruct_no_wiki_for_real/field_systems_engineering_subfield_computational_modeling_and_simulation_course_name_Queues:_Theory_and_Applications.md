Queueing theory is a fundamental concept in computer science, telecommunications, operations research, and many other disciplines. It deals with the study of waiting lines, or queues, and how they behave in different scenarios. In today's fast-paced world, where efficiency and optimization are crucial, queueing theory plays a vital role in understanding and improving systems and processes.

### Section: Introduction to Queueing Systems

Queueing systems are a fundamental concept in queueing theory, and they are used to model a wide range of real-world systems. A queueing system consists of three main components: arrivals, service, and waiting line. Arrivals refer to the customers or entities that enter the system, while service refers to the process of serving these arrivals. The waiting line, also known as the queue, is where the arrivals wait to be served.

### Subsection: Definition and Components of Queueing Systems

#### Definition of Queueing Systems

A queueing system is a mathematical model that represents the flow of arrivals and services in a system. It is characterized by three main components: arrivals, service, and waiting line. These components are interdependent and affect each other's behavior, making queueing systems a complex and dynamic field of study.

#### Components of Queueing Systems

1. Arrivals: Arrivals refer to the customers or entities that enter the system. In queueing theory, arrivals are often modeled as a Poisson process, where the interarrival times follow an exponential distribution. This means that the time between two consecutive arrivals is independent and exponentially distributed.

2. Service: Service refers to the process of serving the arrivals. In queueing theory, service times are also often modeled as an exponential distribution. This means that the time it takes to serve a customer is independent and exponentially distributed.

3. Waiting Line: The waiting line, also known as the queue, is where the arrivals wait to be served. In queueing theory, the waiting line is often modeled as a single queue, where the arrivals are served on a first-come, first-served basis.

Understanding the behavior of these components is crucial for analyzing and optimizing the performance of queueing systems. In the next section, we will focus on one specific type of queueing system, the M/M/s type systems, and explore its fundamental insights.

### Section: Introduction to Queueing Systems

Queueing systems are a fundamental part of many real-world systems, such as call centers, computer networks, and transportation systems. These systems involve the arrival of customers or entities, waiting in a queue, and being served by a server. The study of queueing systems is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of these systems.

#### Characteristics of Queueing Systems

There are several key characteristics that define a queueing system:

- Arrival rate ($\lambda$): This is the rate at which customers or entities arrive at the system. It is usually measured in customers per unit time.
- Service rate ($\mu$): This is the rate at which the server can serve customers. It is usually measured in customers per unit time.
- Utilization ($\rho$): This is the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate, and it represents the percentage of time the server is busy. It is calculated as $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$.

Other important characteristics of queueing systems include the queue length, waiting time, and service time. These factors all play a crucial role in the performance of the system and can be analyzed using queueing theory.

In the next section, we will focus on the M/M/s type systems, which are a specific type of queueing system with exponential interarrival times, exponential service times, and s servers.

### Section: 1.2 Markovian Arrival Process

The Markovian Arrival Process (MAP) is a stochastic process that models the arrival of customers or entities in a queueing system. It is a fundamental concept in queueing theory and is used to analyze and optimize the performance of queueing systems. The MAP is characterized by the following properties:

- The arrivals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.
- The interarrival times between consecutive arrivals follow an exponential distribution.
- The arrival rate is constant and does not depend on the number of customers in the system.

The MAP is a memoryless process, meaning that the probability of an arrival occurring in a given time interval is independent of the number of arrivals that have occurred before. This property is known as the Markov property and is essential for analyzing queueing systems.

#### 1.2a Definition and Properties of Markovian Arrival Process

The Markovian Arrival Process is defined by the following parameters:

- $\lambda$: The arrival rate, which is the average number of arrivals per unit time.
- $T$: The interarrival time, which is the time between consecutive arrivals.
- $P(T \leq t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$: The probability distribution function (PDF) of the interarrival time, which follows an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$.

The properties of the MAP are as follows:

- The interarrival times are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.
- The interarrival times follow an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$.
- The arrival rate is constant and does not depend on the number of customers in the system.
- The MAP is a memoryless process, meaning that the probability of an arrival occurring in a given time interval is independent of the number of arrivals that have occurred before.

The MAP is a fundamental concept in queueing theory and is used to model the arrival process in many real-world systems. It is a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing the performance of queueing systems, and its properties make it a suitable model for a wide range of applications. In the next section, we will explore the M/M/s type systems, which use the MAP as the arrival process and have a single queue, exponential interarrival times, and exponential service times with s servers.

### Section: 1.2 Markovian Arrival Process

In queueing theory, the arrival process refers to the pattern of arrivals of customers or entities to a queueing system. The Markovian arrival process (MAP) is a type of arrival process that is characterized by the memoryless property, meaning that the probability of an arrival occurring in a given time interval is independent of the previous arrivals. This property makes the MAP a popular choice for modeling real-world systems, as it simplifies the analysis and allows for the use of powerful mathematical tools.

#### 1.2b Arrival Rate and Arrival Time Distribution

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is a key parameter in the MAP that represents the average number of arrivals per unit time. It is also known as the arrival intensity or arrival rate parameter. The arrival rate is typically assumed to be constant, but it can also vary over time in some systems.

The arrival time distribution, denoted by $F_A(t)$, is a probability distribution that describes the time between consecutive arrivals in the MAP. It is also known as the interarrival time distribution. In the case of the MAP, the arrival time distribution is exponential, which means that the probability of an arrival occurring in a given time interval is exponentially distributed. This distribution is characterized by a single parameter, $\lambda$, which is equal to the arrival rate.

The exponential arrival time distribution is a fundamental property of the MAP and is crucial for the analysis of queueing systems. It allows for the use of powerful mathematical tools, such as the Poisson process, which is a key concept in queueing theory. In the next section, we will explore the Poisson process and its role in the analysis of M/M/s type systems.

### Section: 1.3 Exponential Service Time

In queueing theory, the service time refers to the amount of time it takes for a server to complete a task for a customer. In M/M/s type systems, the service time is assumed to follow an exponential distribution. This means that the probability of a service time being equal to a certain value is given by the exponential function.

#### 1.3a Definition and Properties of Exponential Service Time

The exponential distribution is defined by a single parameter, denoted by $\lambda$, which represents the rate at which events occur. In the context of queueing theory, $\lambda$ represents the service rate, or the average number of customers that can be served per unit time. The probability density function of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}
$$

where $x$ represents the service time.

One of the key properties of the exponential distribution is that it is memoryless. This means that the probability of a service time being greater than a certain value is not affected by how long the customer has already been waiting. In other words, the service time for a customer who has been waiting for a long time is just as likely to be short as the service time for a customer who has just arrived.

Another important property of the exponential distribution is that it has a constant hazard rate. The hazard rate, denoted by $h(x)$, represents the probability of an event occurring in the next instant, given that it has not occurred yet. In the case of the exponential distribution, the hazard rate is constant and equal to $\lambda$. This means that the probability of a service time being completed in the next instant is always the same, regardless of how long the customer has already been waiting.

Understanding the properties of the exponential distribution is crucial for analyzing M/M/s type systems. In the next section, we will explore how these properties affect the behavior of these systems and their performance measures.

### Section: 1.3 Exponential Service Time

In queueing theory, the service time refers to the amount of time it takes for a server to complete a task for a customer. In M/M/s type systems, the service time is assumed to follow an exponential distribution. This means that the probability of a service time being equal to a certain value is given by the following equation:

$$
P(T_s = t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}
$$

Where $T_s$ is the service time, $\lambda$ is the service rate, and $t$ is the time.

This exponential distribution is commonly used in queueing theory because it has several desirable properties. Firstly, it is a continuous distribution, which means that it can take on any value within a given range. This is important because service times can vary greatly in real-world systems. Secondly, it has a memoryless property, which means that the probability of a service time being equal to a certain value is not affected by how long the customer has already been waiting. This property simplifies the analysis of queueing systems and allows for the use of mathematical models to predict system behavior.

### Subsection: 1.3b Service Rate and Service Time Distribution

The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the inverse of the average service time. It represents the number of customers that can be served per unit of time. In M/M/s type systems, the service rate is equal to the number of servers, s, multiplied by the average service time, $\frac{1}{\mu}$. This can be expressed as:

$$
\mu = s\frac{1}{\mu}
$$

The service rate is a crucial parameter in queueing theory as it directly affects the performance of the system. A higher service rate means that customers can be served faster, resulting in shorter waiting times and a higher throughput.

In M/M/s type systems, the service time distribution is exponential, as mentioned earlier. This means that the probability of a service time being less than or equal to a certain value is given by the following equation:

$$
P(T_s \leq t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
$$

This equation can be used to calculate the probability of a customer waiting for a certain amount of time before being served. It is also used to calculate the expected waiting time and expected queue length in M/M/s type systems, which will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

In conclusion, the service rate and service time distribution are essential concepts in M/M/s type systems. The exponential service time distribution simplifies the analysis of queueing systems, while the service rate directly affects the system's performance. Understanding these concepts is crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamental insights of M/M/s type systems.

### Section: 1.4 Single Server Queues:

In this section, we will focus on single server queues, also known as M/M/1 queues. These are the simplest type of queueing systems, with only one server and one queue. Despite their simplicity, they are widely used to model various real-world systems, such as call centers, customer service desks, and single-lane highways.

#### Subsection: 1.4a Analysis of M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue is characterized by exponential interarrival times and exponential service times with one server. This means that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process, and the service times follow an exponential distribution. These assumptions make the M/M/1 queue a Markovian system, which allows for a straightforward analysis of its behavior.

To analyze the M/M/1 queue, we will use the steady-state probabilities, which represent the probability of having a certain number of customers in the system at any given time. Let $p_n$ be the steady-state probability of having n customers in the system. Using the Markovian property, we can derive the following equations:

$$
p_{n+1} = \lambda p_n \quad \text{for } n \geq 0
$$

$$
p_0 = 1 - \rho
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate and $\rho$ is the utilization, defined as the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate. These equations can be solved to obtain the steady-state probabilities for any given system.

Another important performance measure of the M/M/1 queue is the expected waiting time, denoted by $W$. It represents the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. Using Little's Law, we can relate the expected waiting time to the expected number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$. Little's Law states that $L = \lambda W$, where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate. Therefore, we can calculate the expected waiting time as:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda} = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

where $\mu$ is the service rate. This equation shows that the expected waiting time increases as the utilization increases, and it approaches infinity as the utilization approaches 1. This makes intuitive sense, as a highly utilized system will have a large number of customers waiting in the queue, resulting in longer waiting times.

Similarly, we can calculate the expected queue length, denoted by $L_q$, which represents the average number of customers waiting in the queue. Using Little's Law, we can relate $L_q$ to the expected waiting time and the arrival rate as $L_q = \lambda W$. Therefore, the expected queue length can be calculated as:

$$
L_q = \frac{\rho^2}{1 - \rho} \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

This equation also shows that the expected queue length increases as the utilization increases, and it approaches infinity as the utilization approaches 1.

In addition to these performance measures, we can also calculate the throughput of the M/M/1 queue, denoted by $X$. It represents the average number of customers served per unit time. Using Little's Law, we can relate the throughput to the expected number of customers in the system as $X = \lambda L$. Therefore, the throughput can be calculated as:

$$
X = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho} \lambda
$$

This equation shows that the throughput decreases as the utilization increases, and it approaches 0 as the utilization approaches 1. This is because a highly utilized system will have a large number of customers waiting in the queue, resulting in a slower rate of serving customers.

In conclusion, the M/M/1 queue is a simple yet powerful model for analyzing the behavior of single server queues. Its steady-state probabilities, expected waiting time, expected queue length, and throughput provide valuable insights into the performance of the system. In the next section, we will explore more complex queueing systems with multiple servers and queues.

To evaluate the performance of a queueing system, we need to measure various metrics that can provide insights into its behavior. In the case of the M/M/1 queue, there are several performance measures that are commonly used.

##### Utilization

Utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is defined as the ratio of the average service rate to the average arrival rate. In other words, it represents the percentage of time that the server is busy serving customers. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $\mu$ is the average service rate.

##### Throughput

Throughput, denoted by $X$, is defined as the average number of customers that are served per unit time. In the case of the M/M/1 queue, it can be calculated as:

$$
X = \lambda (1 - \rho)
$$

This equation makes intuitive sense, as the throughput is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the probability that the server is idle.

##### Expected Waiting Time

The expected waiting time, denoted by $W$, is the average amount of time that a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It can be calculated as:

$$
W = \frac{\rho}{\mu(1 - \rho)}
$$

This equation shows that the expected waiting time is directly proportional to the utilization and inversely proportional to the service rate.

##### Expected Queue Length

The expected queue length, denoted by $L_q$, is the average number of customers waiting in the queue at any given time. It can be calculated as:

$$
L_q = \frac{\rho^2}{1 - \rho}
$$

This equation shows that the expected queue length is directly proportional to the utilization squared and inversely proportional to the difference between 1 and the utilization.

By understanding these performance measures, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of the M/M/1 queue and make informed decisions to optimize its performance. In the next section, we will explore the steady-state probabilities of the M/M/1 queue, which will provide a deeper understanding of its behavior.

### Section: 1.5 Multiple Server Queues

In the previous section, we discussed the basic concepts and definitions of queueing theory and introduced the M/M/s type systems. In this section, we will focus on the analysis of M/M/s queues, which will provide us with a deeper understanding of their behavior and performance.

#### Subsection: 1.5a Analysis of M/M/s Queue

The M/M/s queue is a type of queueing system with a single queue, exponential interarrival times, and exponential service times with s servers. It is a fundamental model in queueing theory and has been extensively studied due to its simplicity and wide range of applications.

To analyze the M/M/s queue, we will use the Markov chain approach, which is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of stochastic processes. In this approach, we will model the system as a Markov chain, where the states represent the number of customers in the system. The transition probabilities between states are determined by the arrival and service rates.

Using this approach, we can derive the steady-state probabilities, which represent the long-term behavior of the system. These probabilities can be used to calculate the performance measures of the system, such as the expected waiting time and expected queue length.

One of the key insights of the M/M/s queue is the relationship between the arrival rate, service rate, and utilization. The utilization of the system is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate. When the utilization is less than 1, the system is stable, and the expected queue length and waiting time are finite. However, when the utilization is greater than 1, the system becomes unstable, and the expected queue length and waiting time become infinite.

In addition to the steady-state probabilities, we can also analyze the performance measures of the M/M/s queue, such as the throughput and the average number of customers in the system. These measures provide valuable insights into the efficiency and capacity of the system.

Overall, the analysis of M/M/s queues provides us with a deeper understanding of their behavior and performance. This understanding is crucial for optimizing the performance of these systems and improving their efficiency in various applications. In the next section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

### Section: 1.5 Multiple Server Queues

In the previous section, we discussed the basic concepts and definitions of queueing theory and introduced the M/M/s type systems. In this section, we will focus on the performance measures of M/M/s queues and how they can be used to analyze and optimize the behavior of these systems.

#### Subsection: 1.5b Performance Measures of M/M/s Queue

The performance measures of a queueing system provide valuable insights into its behavior and efficiency. In this subsection, we will discuss the performance measures of M/M/s queues and how they can be calculated.

##### Utilization

Utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is defined as the ratio of the average service rate to the average arrival rate. In M/M/s queues, the utilization can be calculated as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{s\mu}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $\mu$ is the average service rate. The utilization of a queueing system is an important measure as it indicates the level of congestion in the system. A high utilization value indicates that the system is operating at or near its capacity, while a low utilization value indicates that the system has spare capacity.

##### Throughput

Throughput, denoted by $X$, is defined as the average number of customers that successfully complete service per unit time. In M/M/s queues, the throughput can be calculated as:

$$
X = \lambda(1-P_0)
$$

where $P_0$ is the probability that the system is empty. The throughput of a queueing system is a measure of its efficiency and can be used to compare different systems.

##### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$, is defined as the average number of customers in the queue plus the average number of customers being served. In M/M/s queues, the average number of customers in the system can be calculated as:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} + \frac{\rho^s}{1-\rho}\frac{s}{s-1}
$$

This measure is important as it indicates the average workload of the system and can be used to determine the optimal number of servers needed to achieve a desired level of performance.

##### Expected Waiting Time

The expected waiting time, denoted by $W$, is defined as the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. In M/M/s queues, the expected waiting time can be calculated as:

$$
W = \frac{\rho}{\mu(1-\rho)}
$$

This measure is crucial for understanding the customer experience and can be used to optimize the system to reduce waiting times.

##### Expected Queue Length

The expected queue length, denoted by $Q$, is defined as the average number of customers waiting in the queue. In M/M/s queues, the expected queue length can be calculated as:

$$
Q = \frac{\rho^s}{1-\rho}\frac{\rho}{s(1-\rho)}
$$

This measure is important for understanding the level of congestion in the system and can be used to optimize the system to reduce queue lengths.

In this section, we discussed the performance measures of M/M/s queues, including utilization, throughput, average number of customers in the system, expected waiting time, and expected queue length.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of queueing theory and its applications in various fields. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the fundamental concept of Little's Law and its generalizations. Little's Law is a fundamental theorem in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in a queue to the average waiting time and the average arrival rate. It is a powerful tool that has found applications in various fields such as operations research, computer science, and telecommunications.

The chapter will begin with an overview of Little's Law and its significance in queueing theory. We will then explore the various generalizations of Little's Law, including the extended version, the reversed version, and the time-dependent version. These generalizations have been developed to cater to different scenarios and have proven to be valuable in understanding complex queueing systems.

Next, we will discuss the applications of Little's Law and its generalizations in different fields. We will explore how it has been used to optimize processes in manufacturing, service industries, and transportation systems. We will also look at its applications in computer networks, where it has been used to improve network performance and reduce congestion.

The chapter will conclude with a discussion on the limitations of Little's Law and its generalizations. We will explore the assumptions and conditions under which these laws hold true and the scenarios where they may not be applicable. This will provide a better understanding of the scope and limitations of these laws and their practical implications.

In summary, this chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of Little's Law and its generalizations, their applications, and their limitations. It will serve as a foundation for further exploration of queueing theory and its advanced applications in the following chapters. 


## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations:

### Section 2.1: Arrival Rate and Arrival Process:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of queueing theory and its applications in various fields. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the fundamental concept of Little's Law and its generalizations. Little's Law is a fundamental theorem in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in a queue to the average waiting time and the average arrival rate. It is a powerful tool that has found applications in various fields such as operations research, computer science, and telecommunications.

### Subsection 2.1a: Definition and Calculation of Arrival Rate

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is a key parameter in queueing theory that represents the rate at which customers arrive at a queue. It is defined as the average number of arrivals per unit time. In other words, it is the ratio of the total number of arrivals to the total time period. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{N}{T}
$$

Where $N$ is the total number of arrivals and $T$ is the total time period.

The arrival rate is an important parameter as it directly affects the performance of a queueing system. A higher arrival rate means that the queue will have more customers waiting, leading to longer waiting times and potentially higher congestion. On the other hand, a lower arrival rate means that the queue will have fewer customers waiting, resulting in shorter waiting times and lower congestion.

The arrival rate can be calculated in different ways depending on the type of arrival process. In a Poisson arrival process, the arrival rate is constant over time and can be calculated as the ratio of the average number of arrivals to the average inter-arrival time. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\bar{N}}{\bar{X}}
$$

Where $\bar{N}$ is the average number of arrivals and $\bar{X}$ is the average inter-arrival time.

In a non-Poisson arrival process, the arrival rate may vary over time. In such cases, the arrival rate can be calculated as the ratio of the total number of arrivals to the total time period. However, this may not accurately represent the arrival rate at a specific time, and other methods such as regression analysis may be used to estimate the arrival rate.

In summary, the arrival rate is a crucial parameter in queueing theory that represents the rate at which customers arrive at a queue. It can be calculated in different ways depending on the type of arrival process and is directly related to the performance of a queueing system. In the next section, we will explore Little's Law and its significance in queueing theory.


## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations:

### Section 2.1: Arrival Rate and Arrival Process:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of queueing theory and its applications in various fields. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the fundamental concept of Little's Law and its generalizations. Little's Law is a fundamental theorem in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in a queue to the average waiting time and the average arrival rate. It is a powerful tool that has found applications in various fields such as operations research, computer science, and telecommunications.

### Subsection 2.1a: Definition and Calculation of Arrival Rate

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is a key parameter in queueing theory that represents the rate at which customers arrive at a queue. It is defined as the average number of arrivals per unit time. In other words, it is the ratio of the total number of arrivals to the total time period. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{N}{T}
$$

Where $N$ is the total number of arrivals and $T$ is the total time period.

The arrival rate is an important parameter as it directly affects the performance of a queueing system. A higher arrival rate means that the queue will have more customers waiting, leading to longer waiting times and potentially higher congestion. On the other hand, a lower arrival rate means that the queue will have fewer customers waiting, resulting in shorter waiting times and lower congestion.

The arrival rate can be calculated in different ways depending on the type of arrival process. In a Poisson arrival process, the arrival rate is constant over time and can be calculated as the ratio of the average number of arrivals to the average inter-arrival time. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\bar{N}}{\bar{X}}
$$

Where $\bar{N}$ is the average number of arrivals and $\bar{X}$ is the average inter-arrival time.

In a non-Poisson arrival process, the arrival rate may vary over time and cannot be calculated using the same formula as in a Poisson process. Instead, it can be calculated by dividing the total number of arrivals by the total time period, as shown in the formula above. However, this method may not accurately represent the arrival rate in a non-Poisson process, as it does not take into account any variations or patterns in the arrival rate.

To accurately model the arrival process in a non-Poisson process, we can use more advanced techniques such as time series analysis or Markov chains. These methods can help us identify any patterns or trends in the arrival rate and allow us to make more accurate predictions about the performance of a queueing system.

In conclusion, the arrival rate is a crucial parameter in queueing theory that directly affects the performance of a queueing system. It can be calculated using different methods depending on the type of arrival process, and accurate modeling of the arrival process is essential for making accurate predictions about the performance of a queueing system. In the next section, we will discuss the Poisson process in more detail and its applications in queueing theory.


## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations:

### Section 2.2: Service Rate and Service Time:

In the previous section, we discussed the arrival rate and arrival process in queueing theory. In this section, we will focus on the service rate and service time, which are equally important parameters in understanding the behavior of a queueing system.

### Subsection 2.2a: Definition and Calculation of Service Rate

The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is a key parameter in queueing theory that represents the rate at which customers are served by the system. It is defined as the average number of customers served per unit time. In other words, it is the ratio of the total number of customers served to the total time period. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\mu = \frac{N}{T}
$$

Where $N$ is the total number of customers served and $T$ is the total time period.

Similar to the arrival rate, the service rate also has a significant impact on the performance of a queueing system. A higher service rate means that the system can serve more customers in a given time period, resulting in shorter waiting times and lower congestion. On the other hand, a lower service rate means that the system can serve fewer customers in a given time period, leading to longer waiting times and potentially higher congestion.

The service rate can also be calculated in different ways depending on the type of service process. In a Poisson service process, the service rate is constant over time and can be calculated as the ratio of the average number of customers served to the average service time. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\mu = \frac{\bar{N}}{\bar{S}}
$$

Where $\bar{N}$ is the average number of customers served and $\bar{S}$ is the average service time.

In a non-Poisson service process, the service rate may vary over time, and the calculation becomes more complex. However, the fundamental concept remains the same - the service rate is the ratio of the total number of customers served to the total time period.

Understanding the service rate is crucial in analyzing and optimizing queueing systems. It allows us to predict the behavior of the system and make informed decisions to improve its performance. In the next subsection, we will discuss the relationship between the arrival rate and service rate, which is a fundamental concept in queueing theory.


## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations:

### Section 2.2: Service Rate and Service Time:

In the previous section, we discussed the arrival rate and arrival process in queueing theory. In this section, we will focus on the service rate and service time, which are equally important parameters in understanding the behavior of a queueing system.

### Subsection 2.2b: Modeling Service Time: Exponential Distribution

In queueing theory, the service time refers to the amount of time it takes for a customer to be served by the system. It is a crucial factor in determining the performance of a queueing system, as it directly affects the waiting time and congestion levels.

One commonly used model for service time is the exponential distribution. This distribution is often used because it has a simple and tractable mathematical form, making it easier to analyze and calculate. It is also a good approximation for many real-world service processes.

The exponential distribution is characterized by a single parameter, denoted by $\lambda$, which represents the average service rate. This parameter is also known as the rate parameter, as it determines the rate at which customers are served by the system. The probability density function (PDF) of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}
$$

Where $x$ is the service time and $\lambda$ is the rate parameter.

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}
$$

The mean and variance of the exponential distribution are given by:

$$
E[x] = \frac{1}{\lambda}
$$

$$
Var[x] = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}
$$

The exponential distribution has the property of memorylessness, which means that the probability of a service time exceeding a certain value is not affected by how long the customer has already been waiting. This property makes it a suitable model for many real-world service processes, such as phone calls, customer service interactions, and repair times.

In a queueing system, the service rate can be calculated as the reciprocal of the average service time, i.e. $\mu = \frac{1}{\bar{S}}$. This means that the service rate is directly proportional to the rate parameter $\lambda$ in the exponential distribution. A higher service rate (or lower average service time) corresponds to a higher value of $\lambda$, and vice versa.

In conclusion, the exponential distribution is a useful model for service time in queueing theory. It allows us to analyze and understand the behavior of a queueing system, and its memorylessness property makes it a good approximation for many real-world service processes. In the next section, we will explore how the exponential distribution can be used to model the interarrival times in a queueing system.


## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations:

### Section 2.3: Utilization and Queue Length:

In the previous section, we discussed the service rate and service time in queueing theory. In this section, we will focus on the utilization and queue length, which are equally important parameters in understanding the behavior of a queueing system.

### Subsection 2.3a: Definition and Calculation of Utilization

Utilization is a measure of how busy a system is, and it is defined as the ratio of the average service rate to the average arrival rate. In other words, it represents the proportion of time that the system is being used to serve customers. It is denoted by the symbol $\rho$ and is calculated as follows:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

Where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $\mu$ is the average service rate.

Utilization is an important metric in queueing theory as it directly affects the performance of a system. A high utilization rate means that the system is operating close to its capacity, which can lead to longer waiting times and higher congestion levels. On the other hand, a low utilization rate means that the system has excess capacity and is not being fully utilized.

To better understand the concept of utilization, let's consider an example. Suppose we have a single-server queueing system with an average arrival rate of 10 customers per hour and an average service rate of 12 customers per hour. The utilization of this system would be:

$$
\rho = \frac{10}{12} = 0.83
$$

This means that the system is operating at 83% of its capacity, and there is a high chance of customers experiencing longer waiting times and congestion.

Utilization can also be calculated for individual servers in a multi-server system. In this case, the utilization of each server is calculated by dividing its average service rate by the total arrival rate to the system. For example, in a three-server system with an average arrival rate of 30 customers per hour and an average service rate of 12 customers per hour per server, the utilization of each server would be:

$$
\rho = \frac{12}{30} = 0.4
$$

This means that each server is operating at 40% of its capacity, and there is still room for more customers to be served without causing congestion.

In summary, utilization is a crucial parameter in queueing theory that measures the efficiency of a system. It is calculated by dividing the average service rate by the average arrival rate and can be used to determine the performance of a system and identify potential issues such as congestion. In the next section, we will discuss the queue length, which is another important metric in queueing theory.


## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations:

### Section 2.3: Utilization and Queue Length:

In the previous section, we discussed the service rate and service time in queueing theory. In this section, we will focus on the utilization and queue length, which are equally important parameters in understanding the behavior of a queueing system.

### Subsection 2.3b: Relationship between Utilization and Queue Length

In the previous subsection, we defined and calculated the utilization of a queueing system. In this subsection, we will explore the relationship between utilization and queue length.

As mentioned before, utilization is a measure of how busy a system is, while queue length is a measure of the number of customers waiting in the queue. Intuitively, we can see that there is a relationship between these two parameters. As the utilization of a system increases, the queue length is also expected to increase. This is because a higher utilization means that the system is operating close to its capacity, and there is a higher chance of customers experiencing longer waiting times and congestion.

To understand this relationship more formally, we can use Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a system, denoted by $L$, is equal to the average arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system, denoted by $W$. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

We can also express the average time a customer spends in the system as the sum of the average waiting time, denoted by $W_q$, and the average service time, denoted by $W_s$. This can be written as:

$$
W = W_q + W_s
$$

Substituting this into Little's Law, we get:

$$
L = \lambda (W_q + W_s)
$$

We can further simplify this equation by dividing both sides by the average arrival rate, $\lambda$, which gives us:

$$
\frac{L}{\lambda} = W_q + W_s
$$

Recalling that the utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is equal to the ratio of the average arrival rate to the average service rate, we can rewrite this equation as:

$$
\frac{L}{\lambda} = W_q + \frac{W_s}{\lambda/\mu} = W_q + \rho W_s
$$

This equation shows us the relationship between utilization and queue length. As the utilization increases, the second term on the right-hand side, $\rho W_s$, also increases. This means that as the utilization increases, the average waiting time, $W_q$, also increases, leading to a longer queue length, $L$.

To better understand this relationship, let's consider an example. Suppose we have a single-server queueing system with an average arrival rate of 10 customers per hour and an average service rate of 12 customers per hour. Using Little's Law, we can calculate the average number of customers in the system as:

$$
L = \lambda W = 10 \times (W_q + W_s)
$$

If we assume that the average waiting time, $W_q$, is 0.5 hours and the average service time, $W_s$, is 0.25 hours, then the average number of customers in the system would be:

$$
L = 10 \times (0.5 + 0.25) = 7.5
$$

This means that on average, there are 7.5 customers in the system at any given time. Now, if we increase the utilization of the system to 90%, the average waiting time would increase to 0.9 hours, and the average number of customers in the system would increase to:

$$
L = 10 \times (0.9 + 0.25) = 11.5
$$

This shows us that as the utilization increases, the queue length also increases, highlighting the importance of managing utilization in a queueing system.

In conclusion, the relationship between utilization and queue length is an important concept in queueing theory. As the utilization of a system increases, the queue length also increases, leading to longer waiting times and higher congestion levels. This highlights the need for proper utilization management in order to maintain a well-functioning queueing system.


### Section: 2.4 Response Time and Waiting Time:

In the previous section, we discussed the relationship between utilization and queue length in a queueing system. In this section, we will focus on two important performance measures: response time and waiting time.

#### 2.4a Definition and Calculation of Response Time

Response time, also known as the system response time, is the total time a customer spends in the system, including both waiting time and service time. It is a critical measure of performance in a queueing system as it directly affects customer satisfaction and the overall efficiency of the system.

To calculate the response time, we can use Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a system, denoted by $L$, is equal to the average arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system, denoted by $W$. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

We can also express the average time a customer spends in the system as the sum of the average waiting time, denoted by $W_q$, and the average service time, denoted by $W_s$. This can be written as:

$$
W = W_q + W_s
$$

Substituting this into Little's Law, we get:

$$
L = \lambda (W_q + W_s)
$$

We can further simplify this equation by dividing both sides by the average arrival rate, $\lambda$, which gives us:

$$
\frac{L}{\lambda} = W_q + W_s
$$

Recalling that the utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is equal to the ratio of the average arrival rate to the service rate, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
\frac{L}{\lambda} = \frac{W_q}{\mu} + W_s
$$

where $\mu$ is the service rate. This equation tells us that the response time is equal to the average waiting time divided by the service rate, plus the average service time. This makes intuitive sense as the response time is the sum of the time spent waiting in the queue and the time spent being served.

In practice, the response time can be calculated by measuring the average waiting time and service time and plugging them into the equation above. It is important to note that the response time may vary depending on the arrival rate and service rate, and it is essential to consider these factors when analyzing and optimizing a queueing system.

In the next section, we will discuss the waiting time in more detail and explore its relationship with the arrival rate and service rate.


### Section: 2.4 Response Time and Waiting Time:

In the previous section, we discussed the relationship between utilization and queue length in a queueing system. In this section, we will focus on two important performance measures: response time and waiting time.

#### 2.4a Definition and Calculation of Response Time

Response time, also known as the system response time, is the total time a customer spends in the system, including both waiting time and service time. It is a critical measure of performance in a queueing system as it directly affects customer satisfaction and the overall efficiency of the system.

To calculate the response time, we can use Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a system, denoted by $L$, is equal to the average arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system, denoted by $W$. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

We can also express the average time a customer spends in the system as the sum of the average waiting time, denoted by $W_q$, and the average service time, denoted by $W_s$. This can be written as:

$$
W = W_q + W_s
$$

Substituting this into Little's Law, we get:

$$
L = \lambda (W_q + W_s)
$$

We can further simplify this equation by dividing both sides by the average arrival rate, $\lambda$, which gives us:

$$
\frac{L}{\lambda} = W_q + W_s
$$

Recalling that the utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is equal to the ratio of the average arrival rate to the service rate, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
\frac{L}{\lambda} = \frac{W_q}{\mu} + W_s
$$

where $\mu$ is the service rate. This equation tells us that the response time is equal to the average waiting time divided by the service rate, plus the average service time. This makes intuitive sense as the response time is the sum of the time spent waiting in the queue and the time spent being served.

#### 2.4b Estimating Waiting Time in Queueing Systems

In order to estimate the waiting time in a queueing system, we can use the concept of Little's Law once again. However, this time we will focus on the average number of customers waiting in the queue, denoted by $L_q$. This can be calculated by subtracting the average number of customers being served, denoted by $L_s$, from the total number of customers in the system, $L$. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

$$
L_q = L - L_s
$$

Using Little's Law, we can then calculate the average waiting time, $W_q$, by dividing the average number of customers waiting in the queue by the arrival rate, $\lambda$. This can be written as:

$$
W_q = \frac{L_q}{\lambda}
$$

This equation tells us that the waiting time is directly proportional to the average number of customers waiting in the queue. This means that as the queue length increases, the waiting time also increases. This is an important consideration for queueing systems, as long waiting times can lead to dissatisfied customers and decreased efficiency.

In practice, the waiting time can also be estimated by using queuing models, such as the M/M/1 model, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers in the system. These models can provide more accurate estimates of waiting time in complex queueing systems. 


### Conclusion

We have seen how Little's Law relates the average number of customers in a system to the average time they spend in the system. This law has been proven to hold true for a wide range of queueing systems, making it a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing queues in various real-world applications.

We have also discussed generalizations of Little's Law, such as the extended version for non-stationary systems and the multi-class version for systems with multiple types of customers.

### Section: 3.1 Poisson Distribution:

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that is commonly used to model the arrival process in queueing systems. It is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, who first introduced it in the early 19th century. The Poisson distribution is often used in situations where the number of arrivals in a given time period is rare but can occur at any time.

#### Subsection: 3.1a Definition and Properties of Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is defined by a single parameter, λ, which represents the average rate of arrivals per unit time. The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

Where X is a random variable representing the number of arrivals, k is the number of arrivals, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.

The properties of the Poisson distribution are as follows:

1. The mean of the Poisson distribution is equal to λ.
2. The variance of the Poisson distribution is also equal to λ.
3. The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution, meaning that the number of arrivals can only take on integer values.
4. The Poisson distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an arrival occurring in a given time period is independent of the number of arrivals that have already occurred.

The Poisson distribution is often used to model the arrival process in queueing systems because it satisfies the assumptions of a Poisson process. A Poisson process is a stochastic process that models the arrival of events over time, where the events occur independently and at a constant rate.

In queueing theory, the Poisson distribution is used to model the arrival process of customers to a queue. For example, in a single-server queueing system, the arrival rate of customers can be modeled using a Poisson distribution with a parameter λ representing the average arrival rate. This allows us to calculate the probability of a certain number of customers arriving in a given time period, which is essential for analyzing the performance of a queueing system.

In the next section, we will discuss the exponential distribution, which is commonly used to model service times in queueing systems.

It is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, who first introduced it in the early 19th century. The Poisson distribution is often used to model the number of arrivals in a given time interval, assuming that the arrivals occur independently and at a constant rate.

#### Subsection: 3.1b Application of Poisson Distribution in Queueing Systems

The Poisson distribution has many applications in queueing systems. One of its main uses is in modeling the arrival process. In a single-server queueing system, the arrival process can be modeled as a Poisson process, where the number of arrivals in a given time interval follows a Poisson distribution. This is a reasonable assumption for many real-world scenarios, such as customer arrivals at a bank or phone calls at a call center.

The Poisson distribution is also used to calculate the probability of having a certain number of customers in the system at a given time. This is important in determining the system's performance, such as the average waiting time and the probability of a customer having to wait in the queue.

In multi-server queueing systems, the Poisson distribution is used to model the arrival process for each server. This allows us to analyze the system's performance and determine the optimal number of servers needed to meet a certain service level.

The Poisson distribution is also used in conjunction with other distributional laws, such as the exponential distribution, to model the overall behavior of a queueing system. By combining these distributions, we can better understand the system's performance and make informed decisions to improve it.

In summary, the Poisson distribution is a fundamental tool in queueing theory and has many applications in modeling the arrival process and analyzing the performance of queueing systems. In the next section, we will explore the exponential distribution, which is commonly used to model service times in queueing systems.

### Section: 3.2 Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is often used to model the service times in queueing systems. It is a special case of the gamma distribution and has a single parameter, λ, which represents the rate of the exponential decay. The probability density function (PDF) of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\lambda e^{-\lambda x}, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
1 - e^{-\lambda x}, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

#### 3.2a Definition and Properties of Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. Some of these properties are:

- The mean of the exponential distribution is equal to 1/λ, and the variance is equal to 1/λ².
- The exponential distribution is memoryless, which means that the probability of an event occurring in the next time interval is independent of how much time has already passed.
- The exponential distribution is a special case of the Weibull distribution, with a shape parameter of 1.
- The exponential distribution is often used to model the inter-arrival times in a Poisson process, where the number of arrivals in a given time interval follows a Poisson distribution.

The exponential distribution is widely used in queueing theory because it provides a simple and intuitive way to model service times. It is also used in reliability analysis, where it is used to model the time until failure of a system or component.

In the next section, we will explore the Erlang distribution, which is a generalization of the exponential distribution and is commonly used to model service times in multi-server systems.

$$

1 - e^{-\lambda x}, & x \geq 0 \\

\end{cases}
$$

The exponential distribution is often used to model service times in queueing systems because it has the memoryless property. This means that the probability of a service time exceeding a certain value is not affected by the amount of time already spent in the system. This property makes it a suitable distribution for modeling service times in systems where the service times are independent of each other.

#### 3.2b Application of Exponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

The exponential distribution has many applications in queueing systems. One of its main uses is in modeling service times in single-server systems. In such systems, the service times are often assumed to follow an exponential distribution, and this assumption has been found to be accurate in many real-world scenarios.

Another application of the exponential distribution is in modeling inter-arrival times in queueing systems. In many cases, the arrival process in a queueing system can be modeled as a Poisson process, which has an exponential distribution for inter-arrival times. This makes the exponential distribution a useful tool for analyzing and optimizing the performance of queueing systems.

In multi-server systems, the exponential distribution is often used to model the service times of each server. However, in this case, the service times are not independent, and the Erlang distribution is a more suitable choice. The Erlang distribution is a generalization of the exponential distribution and is commonly used to model service times in multi-server systems.

In conclusion, the exponential distribution is a fundamental distribution in queueing theory and has many applications in modeling service times and inter-arrival times in queueing systems. Its memoryless property makes it a useful tool for analyzing and optimizing the performance of queueing systems. In the next section, we will explore the Erlang distribution in more detail and its applications in multi-server systems.

The Erlang distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is commonly used to model the service times in queueing systems. It is a special case of the gamma distribution and has two parameters, k and λ, which represent the shape and rate parameters, respectively. The probability density function (PDF) of the Erlang distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{\lambda^k x^{k-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!}, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Erlang distribution is given by:

$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
1 - e^{-\lambda x} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{(\lambda x)^i}{i!}, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

#### 3.3a Definition and Properties of Erlang Distribution

The Erlang distribution is named after the Danish mathematician Agner Krarup Erlang, who first used it to model the number of telephone calls arriving at a switchboard. It is a versatile distribution that can be used to model a wide range of phenomena, including the number of customers in a queue, the number of arrivals in a given time interval, and the service times in a queueing system.

The Erlang distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. First, it is a continuous distribution, which means that it can take on any real value. Second, it is a memoryless distribution, which means that the probability of an event occurring in a given time interval is independent of the time that has elapsed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to model the behavior of queueing systems without considering the history of previous events.

Another important property of the Erlang distribution is that it is a special case of the gamma distribution. This means that we can use the properties of the gamma distribution to derive the properties of the Erlang distribution. For example, the mean and variance of the Erlang distribution can be calculated using the mean and variance of the gamma distribution.

In conclusion, the Erlang distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory that allows us to model the randomness of service times in queueing systems. Its properties make it a versatile and useful distribution for a wide range of applications. In the next section, we will explore another important distribution in queueing theory, the hyperexponential distribution.

It is a versatile distribution that can be used to model a wide range of phenomena, including the number of customers in a queue, the number of arrivals in a given time interval, and the time between arrivals.

#### 3.3b Application of Erlang Distribution in Queueing Systems

The Erlang distribution is particularly useful in queueing systems because it allows us to model the service times of customers. In a queueing system, customers arrive at a service facility and wait in a queue until they are served. The service time is the amount of time it takes for a customer to be served and is a critical factor in determining the performance of a queueing system.

By using the Erlang distribution to model service times, we can make predictions about the average waiting time and queue length in a queueing system. This information is essential for optimizing the performance of a queueing system and ensuring that customers are served efficiently.

One example of the application of the Erlang distribution in queueing systems is in call centers. Call centers often experience high call volumes, and it is crucial for them to manage their resources efficiently to reduce customer wait times. By using the Erlang distribution to model the service times of calls, call centers can make informed decisions about the number of operators needed to handle incoming calls and minimize customer wait times.

In conclusion, the Erlang distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory that allows us to model the service times in queueing systems. Its applications are widespread, and it has proven to be a valuable tool in optimizing the performance of queueing systems in various industries.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the basic concepts of queueing theory and its applications. We learned about the components of a queueing system, such as arrivals, service times, and queue discipline. We also explored the different types of queueing systems, including single-server and multi-server systems. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of queueing theory by studying distributional laws.

Distributional laws play a crucial role in queueing theory as they help us understand the behavior of queueing systems. They provide us with a way to model the randomness of arrivals and service times, which are essential components of any queueing system. In this chapter, we will explore various distributional laws and their properties, including the Poisson distribution, the exponential distribution, and the Erlang distribution.

### Section: 3.3 Erlang Distribution

The Erlang distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is commonly used to model the service times in queueing systems. It is a special case of the gamma distribution and has two parameters, k and λ, which represent the shape and rate parameters, respectively. The probability density function (PDF) of the Erlang distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{\lambda^k x^{k-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!}, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

The Erlang distribution is often used to model service times in queueing systems because it has a finite support and can handle non-negative values. This makes it a suitable choice for systems where the service times are known to be bounded. Additionally, the Erlang distribution has a simple and intuitive shape, making it easy to interpret and use in practical applications.

#### 3.3a Definition and Properties of Erlang Distribution

As mentioned earlier, the Erlang distribution has two parameters, k and λ, which represent the shape and rate parameters, respectively. The shape parameter, k, determines the number of phases in the Erlang distribution, while the rate parameter, λ, controls the rate at which the service times occur. The mean and variance of the Erlang distribution are given by:

$$
\mu = \frac{k}{\lambda}
$$

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{k}{\lambda^2}
$$

The Erlang distribution also has the property of memorylessness, which means that the probability of a service time exceeding a certain value is independent of the time already spent in service. This property is particularly useful in queueing theory as it allows us to model the behavior of a queueing system without considering its past history.

In addition to its use in modeling service times, the Erlang distribution is also used to model inter-arrival times in queueing systems. In this case, the shape parameter, k, represents the number of arrivals in a given time period, and the rate parameter, λ, represents the arrival rate. This makes the Erlang distribution a versatile tool in queueing theory, as it can be used to model both arrivals and service times in a queueing system.

In conclusion, the Erlang distribution is a fundamental distribution in queueing theory that is widely used to model service times and inter-arrival times in queueing systems. Its simple shape, finite support, and memorylessness property make it a valuable tool for understanding and optimizing the performance of queueing systems. In the next section, we will explore another important distributional law in queueing theory, the hyperexponential distribution.

\frac{\lambda^k x^{k-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!}, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

The Erlang distribution is particularly useful in queueing theory because it allows us to model service times that are not exponentially distributed. In many real-world scenarios, service times may follow a distribution that is more complex than the exponential distribution. The Erlang distribution provides a more flexible model that can better capture the variability of service times in a queueing system.

### Subsection: 3.3b Properties of the Erlang Distribution

Before we dive into the application of the Erlang distribution in queueing systems, let's first explore some of its key properties. As mentioned earlier, the Erlang distribution has two parameters, k and λ, which affect the shape and rate of the distribution. The shape parameter, k, determines the number of phases in the Erlang distribution, while the rate parameter, λ, controls the rate at which the distribution decays.

One important property of the Erlang distribution is that it is a memoryless distribution. This means that the probability of an event occurring in a given time interval is independent of how much time has already passed. In the context of queueing systems, this property is particularly useful as it allows us to model service times that do not depend on the time spent waiting in the queue.

Another key property of the Erlang distribution is that it is a continuous distribution. This means that the service times in a queueing system are modeled as continuous random variables, rather than discrete ones. This is often a more realistic assumption, as service times in real-world systems are typically measured in continuous units, such as seconds or minutes.

### Subsection: 3.3c Application of the Erlang Distribution in Queueing Systems

Now that we have explored the properties of the Erlang distribution, let's see how it can be applied in queueing systems. As mentioned earlier, the Erlang distribution is commonly used to model service times in queueing systems. This is because it provides a more flexible and accurate representation of service times compared to the exponential distribution.

In a queueing system, the service times can vary depending on the type of service being provided and the number of servers available. By using the Erlang distribution, we can model these variations and better understand the performance of the queueing system. This can help us optimize the system by adjusting the number of servers or implementing different queue disciplines.

In addition to modeling service times, the Erlang distribution can also be used to model the inter-arrival times of customers in a queueing system. This is particularly useful in scenarios where customers arrive in batches or groups, rather than individually. By using the Erlang distribution, we can better understand the arrival patterns and make more informed decisions about how to manage the queue.

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored the Erlang distribution and its properties. We learned that it is a continuous probability distribution that is commonly used to model service times in queueing systems. We also discussed its key properties, including its memoryless and continuous nature. Finally, we saw how the Erlang distribution can be applied in queueing systems to better understand and optimize their performance. In the next section, we will continue our discussion of distributional laws by exploring the hyperexponential distribution.

### Section: 3.5 General Distribution

In the previous sections, we have discussed specific distributional laws such as the Poisson and exponential distributions. However, in many real-world scenarios, the arrival and service times may not follow a specific distribution. In such cases, we can use the general distribution to model the randomness of these times.

#### 3.5a Definition and Properties of General Distribution

The general distribution is a continuous probability distribution that can be used to model any random variable. It is also known as the continuous uniform distribution and is denoted by U(a,b), where a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the distribution, respectively. The probability density function (PDF) of the general distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{b-a}, & a \leq x \leq b \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

The mean and variance of the general distribution are given by:

$$
\mu = \frac{a+b}{2}
$$

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}
$$

One of the key properties of the general distribution is that it is a continuous distribution, meaning that the probability of any specific value occurring is zero. This is because the distribution is defined over a range of values rather than a single value.

Another important property is that the general distribution is symmetric about its mean. This means that the probability of a value being greater than the mean is equal to the probability of it being less than the mean.

The general distribution is also useful in situations where we have limited information about the underlying distribution of the random variable. In such cases, we can use the general distribution as a conservative estimate of the true distribution.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of the general distribution in queueing theory and how it can be used to model real-world scenarios.

The general distribution is a continuous probability distribution that can be used to model the randomness of arrival and service times in a queueing system. It is a versatile distribution that can be used in a wide range of applications, making it an essential tool in queueing theory.

The general distribution is defined by its probability density function (PDF), which is denoted by $f(x)$. The PDF represents the probability of a random variable $X$ taking on a specific value $x$. The PDF must satisfy the following properties:

- $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
- $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx = 1$

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the general distribution is denoted by $F(x)$ and is defined as the probability that a random variable $X$ is less than or equal to a specific value $x$. The CDF is given by:

$$
F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(t) dt
$$

The CDF is a monotonically increasing function and ranges from 0 to 1.

#### 3.5b Application of General Distribution in Queueing Systems

The general distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory as it allows us to model the randomness of arrival and service times in a queueing system without making any assumptions about the underlying distribution. This is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where the arrival and service times may not follow a specific distribution.

One of the main applications of the general distribution in queueing systems is in the analysis and optimization of system performance. By using the general distribution, we can calculate important performance metrics such as the average waiting time, queue length, and system utilization. These metrics are crucial in understanding and improving the efficiency of a queueing system.

Another application of the general distribution is in the design of queueing systems. By using the general distribution, we can determine the optimal number of servers and the appropriate queue discipline for a given system. This helps in minimizing waiting times and improving overall system performance.

In conclusion, the general distribution is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that allows us to model the randomness of arrival and service times in a queueing system. Its versatility and applications make it an essential tool for understanding and optimizing queueing systems. 


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the fundamental distributional laws that are essential in understanding queueing theory. We have discussed the Poisson, Exponential, and Erlang distributions, and their applications in modeling arrival and service times in queueing systems. We have also examined the relationship between these distributions and how they can be used to calculate important performance measures such as the mean and variance of waiting times and queue lengths.

We have seen that the Poisson distribution is commonly used to model the arrival process in queueing systems, while the Exponential distribution is often used to model the service times. The Erlang distribution, on the other hand, is a generalization of the Exponential distribution and is useful in situations where the service times are not exponentially distributed. By understanding these distributions and their properties, we can better analyze and optimize queueing systems to improve their performance.

In addition to the fundamental distributions, we have also discussed the concept of the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will tend towards a normal distribution. This theorem is crucial in queueing theory as it allows us to approximate the behavior of complex queueing systems using simpler models.

Overall, this chapter has provided a solid foundation for understanding the distributional laws that are essential in queueing theory. By mastering these concepts, readers will be well-equipped to tackle more advanced topics in queueing theory and apply them to real-world applications.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction:

In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of conservation laws in queueing theory. Conservation laws are fundamental principles that govern the behavior of queues and play a crucial role in understanding and analyzing queueing systems. These laws are based on the concept of conservation of flow, which states that the amount of flow entering a system must be equal to the amount of flow leaving the system. In the context of queueing theory, this translates to the idea that the number of customers entering a queue must be equal to the number of customers leaving the queue.

We will begin by discussing the basic conservation laws that apply to single-server queues, such as Little's Law and the conservation of customers. We will then move on to more complex systems, such as multi-server queues and networks of queues, and explore how these laws can be extended to these scenarios. We will also discuss the implications of these laws on queueing performance measures, such as queue length and waiting time.

Furthermore, we will explore how conservation laws can be used to design and optimize queueing systems. By understanding the fundamental principles of conservation, we can make informed decisions about system parameters, such as the number of servers and arrival rates, to achieve desired performance goals. We will also discuss how these laws can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as traffic flow and telecommunication networks.

Overall, this chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of conservation laws in queueing theory and their applications. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of these fundamental principles and how they can be used to analyze and improve queueing systems. 


### Section: 4.1 Traffic Intensity:

Traffic intensity is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that measures the utilization of a queueing system. It is defined as the ratio of the average arrival rate of customers to the average service rate of the system. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $\mu$ is the average service rate. This ratio is also known as the utilization factor, as it represents the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers.

#### 4.1a Definition and Calculation of Traffic Intensity

As mentioned earlier, traffic intensity is a measure of the utilization of a queueing system. It is a dimensionless quantity that ranges from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a higher utilization of the system. A traffic intensity of 1 means that the system is operating at full capacity, with no idle time between customer arrivals.

To calculate the traffic intensity of a queueing system, we need to know the average arrival rate and the average service rate. These can be obtained from historical data or by conducting experiments. For example, in a single-server queue, the average arrival rate can be calculated by dividing the total number of arrivals by the total time period, while the average service rate can be calculated by dividing the total number of customers served by the total service time.

Let's consider an example of a single-server queue with an average arrival rate of 10 customers per hour and an average service rate of 12 customers per hour. The traffic intensity of this system would be:

$$
\rho = \frac{10}{12} = 0.83
$$

This means that the system is operating at 83% of its capacity, with an average of 0.83 customers in the system at any given time.

Traffic intensity is an important parameter in queueing theory as it has a direct impact on the performance of a system. As the traffic intensity increases, the average queue length and waiting time also increase, leading to longer customer wait times and potentially lower customer satisfaction. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the traffic intensity when designing and optimizing queueing systems.

In the next section, we will explore how traffic intensity is related to other performance measures, such as queue length and waiting time, and how it can be used to analyze and improve queueing systems.


### Section: 4.1 Traffic Intensity:

Traffic intensity is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that measures the utilization of a queueing system. It is defined as the ratio of the average arrival rate of customers to the average service rate of the system. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $\mu$ is the average service rate. This ratio is also known as the utilization factor, as it represents the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers.

#### 4.1a Definition and Calculation of Traffic Intensity

As mentioned earlier, traffic intensity is a measure of the utilization of a queueing system. It is a dimensionless quantity that ranges from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a higher utilization of the system. A traffic intensity of 1 means that the system is operating at full capacity, with no idle time between customer arrivals.

To calculate the traffic intensity of a queueing system, we need to know the average arrival rate and the average service rate. These can be obtained from historical data or by conducting experiments. For example, in a single-server queue, the average arrival rate can be calculated by dividing the total number of arrivals by the total time period, while the average service rate can be calculated by dividing the total number of customers served by the total service time.

Let's consider an example of a single-server queue with an average arrival rate of 10 customers per hour and an average service rate of 12 customers per hour. The traffic intensity of this system would be:

$$
\rho = \frac{10}{12} = 0.83
$$

This means that the system is operating at 83% of its capacity, with an average of 0.83 customers in the system at any given time.

Traffic intensity is an important parameter in queueing theory as it has a direct impact on the performance of a system. As the traffic intensity increases, the average queue length and waiting time also increase, leading to longer customer wait times and potentially lower customer satisfaction. This relationship between traffic intensity and system performance is known as the conservation law.

### Subsection: 4.1b Relationship between Traffic Intensity and System Performance

The conservation law states that as the traffic intensity increases, the average queue length and waiting time also increase. This can be seen intuitively, as a higher traffic intensity means that more customers are arriving at the system, leading to longer queues and potentially longer waiting times for customers.

Mathematically, the conservation law can be expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}
$$

where $L$ is the average queue length and $\rho$ is the traffic intensity. This equation shows that as the traffic intensity approaches 1, the average queue length approaches infinity, indicating that the system is unable to handle the incoming traffic and is operating at full capacity.

Similarly, the average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

where $W$ is the average waiting time and $\lambda$ is the arrival rate. This equation shows that as the traffic intensity increases, the average waiting time also increases, as the system is unable to process the incoming traffic efficiently.

Understanding the relationship between traffic intensity and system performance is crucial in queueing theory, as it allows us to predict and optimize the performance of queueing systems. By controlling the traffic intensity, we can ensure that the system operates at an optimal level, balancing the trade-off between customer satisfaction and system efficiency. 


### Section: 4.2 Balance Equation:

The balance equation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that is used to describe the behavior of a queueing system. It is based on the principle of conservation of customers, which states that the number of customers entering a system must be equal to the number of customers leaving the system. This principle is analogous to the conservation of mass or energy in physics.

#### 4.2a Definition and Concept of Balance Equation

The balance equation can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\Delta N = \Delta A - \Delta D
$$

where $\Delta N$ is the change in the number of customers in the system, $\Delta A$ is the number of arrivals during a given time period, and $\Delta D$ is the number of departures during the same time period.

This equation can also be written in terms of the average number of customers in the system, denoted by $N$, and the average arrival and departure rates, denoted by $\lambda$ and $\mu$ respectively. In this case, the balance equation becomes:

$$
N = \lambda - \mu
$$

This equation is known as the balance equation in steady-state, as it describes the behavior of a queueing system when it has reached a stable state.

The balance equation is a powerful tool in queueing theory as it allows us to analyze the behavior of a system and make predictions about its performance. By manipulating the equation, we can derive important performance measures such as the average queue length, waiting time, and system utilization.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of the balance equation in different queueing systems and how it can be used to optimize their performance.

$$

where $\Delta N$ is the change in the number of customers in the system, $\Delta A$ is the number of arrivals during a given time period, and $\Delta D$ is the number of departures during the same time period.

This equation can also be written in terms of the average number of customers in the system, denoted by $N$, and the average arrival and departure rates, denoted by $\lambda$ and $\mu$ respectively. In this case, the balance equation becomes:

$$
N = \lambda - \mu
$$

This equation is known as the balance equation in steady-state, as it describes the behavior of a queueing system when it has reached a stable state.

The balance equation is a powerful tool in queueing theory as it allows us to analyze the behavior of a system and make predictions about its performance. By manipulating the equation, we can derive important performance measures such as the average queue length, waiting time, and system utilization.

#### 4.2b Application of Balance Equation in Queueing Systems

The balance equation has numerous applications in queueing systems, making it a crucial concept for understanding and optimizing their performance. In this subsection, we will explore some of the most common applications of the balance equation in queueing theory.

One of the main applications of the balance equation is in determining the average queue length in a system. By rearranging the equation, we can express the average queue length as:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

This equation shows that the average queue length is directly proportional to the arrival rate and inversely proportional to the difference between the arrival and departure rates. This means that as the arrival rate increases or the difference between the arrival and departure rates decreases, the average queue length will also increase.

Another important application of the balance equation is in calculating the average waiting time in a queueing system. By using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average waiting time, we can express the average waiting time as:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

This equation shows that the average waiting time is inversely proportional to the difference between the arrival and departure rates. This means that as the difference between the arrival and departure rates decreases, the average waiting time will increase.

The balance equation can also be used to optimize the performance of a queueing system. By manipulating the equation, we can determine the optimal arrival rate that will result in the highest system utilization. This is known as the traffic intensity, denoted by $\rho$, and is calculated as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

When the traffic intensity is equal to 1, the system is operating at maximum capacity and any increase in the arrival rate will result in a decrease in the system utilization. Therefore, it is important to carefully manage the arrival rate in order to optimize the performance of a queueing system.

In conclusion, the balance equation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that has numerous applications in analyzing and optimizing the performance of queueing systems. By understanding and utilizing this equation, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of these systems and make informed decisions to improve their performance. 


### Section: 4.3 Network Flow Conservation:

Network flow conservation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that extends the balance equation to more complex queueing systems. It is based on the principle of conservation of flow, which states that the total flow into a node in a network must be equal to the total flow out of that node. This principle is analogous to the conservation of mass or energy in physics.

#### 4.3a Definition and Principles of Network Flow Conservation

The network flow conservation equation can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\Delta F = \Delta I - \Delta O
$$

where $\Delta F$ is the change in the total flow at a node, $\Delta I$ is the total inflow to the node, and $\Delta O$ is the total outflow from the node.

This equation can also be written in terms of the average flow at a node, denoted by $F$, and the average inflow and outflow rates, denoted by $\lambda$ and $\mu$ respectively. In this case, the network flow conservation equation becomes:

$$
F = \lambda - \mu
$$

Similar to the balance equation, this equation is known as the network flow conservation equation in steady-state, as it describes the behavior of a queueing system when it has reached a stable state.

The network flow conservation equation is a powerful tool in analyzing the behavior of complex queueing systems. By manipulating the equation, we can derive important performance measures such as the average queue length, waiting time, and system utilization for each node in the network.

#### 4.3b Application of Network Flow Conservation in Queueing Systems

The network flow conservation equation has numerous applications in queueing systems, making it a crucial concept for understanding and optimizing their performance. In this subsection, we will explore some of the most common applications of network flow conservation in queueing theory.

One of the main applications of the network flow conservation equation is in determining the average queue length at each node in a network. By rearranging the equation, we can express the average queue length as a function of the average inflow and outflow rates at each node. This allows us to identify potential bottlenecks in the network and make adjustments to improve overall system performance.

Another important application of the network flow conservation equation is in analyzing the stability of a queueing system. By comparing the average inflow and outflow rates at each node, we can determine if the system is in a stable state or if it is at risk of becoming unstable. This information is crucial for making adjustments to the system to maintain stability and prevent disruptions in service.

In conclusion, network flow conservation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that extends the balance equation to more complex queueing systems.

### Section: 4.3 Network Flow Conservation:

Network flow conservation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that extends the balance equation to more complex queueing systems. It is based on the principle of conservation of flow, which states that the total flow into a node in a network must be equal to the total flow out of that node. This principle is analogous to the conservation of mass or energy in physics.

#### 4.3a Definition and Principles of Network Flow Conservation

The network flow conservation equation can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\Delta F = \Delta I - \Delta O
$$

where $\Delta F$ is the change in the total flow at a node, $\Delta I$ is the total inflow to the node, and $\Delta O$ is the total outflow from the node.

This equation can also be written in terms of the average flow at a node, denoted by $F$, and the average inflow and outflow rates, denoted by $\lambda$ and $\mu$ respectively. In this case, the network flow conservation equation becomes:

$$
F = \lambda - \mu
$$

Similar to the balance equation, this equation is known as the network flow conservation equation in steady-state, as it describes the behavior of a queueing system when it has reached a stable state.

The network flow conservation equation is a powerful tool in analyzing the behavior of complex queueing systems. By manipulating the equation, we can derive important performance measures such as the average queue length, waiting time, and system utilization for each node in the network.

By using the equation, we can calculate the average inflow and outflow rates at each node and then use these values to determine the average queue length. This information is crucial for understanding the performance of a queueing system and identifying potential bottlenecks.

Another important application of network flow conservation is in analyzing the waiting time in a queueing system. By using the equation, we can calculate the average inflow and outflow rates at each node and then use these values to determine the average waiting time. This information is essential for optimizing the performance of a queueing system and reducing customer wait times.

Finally, the network flow conservation equation can also be used to analyze the system utilization at each node in a queueing network. By using the equation, we can calculate the average inflow and outflow rates at each node and then use these values to determine the system utilization. This information is crucial for identifying potential bottlenecks and optimizing the performance of a queueing system.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the basics of queueing theory, including the fundamental concepts and models. We have also discussed various applications of queueing theory in real-world scenarios. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the theory and explore the PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) property. This property is essential in understanding the behavior of queueing systems and is widely used in advanced applications of queueing theory.

The PASTA property states that the proportion of arrivals that see the system in a particular state is equal to the proportion of time the system spends in that state. This property holds for any arrival process that follows a Poisson distribution, which is a common assumption in many queueing models. Understanding this property is crucial in analyzing and predicting the behavior of queueing systems, as it allows us to make accurate estimations of key performance metrics such as waiting times and queue lengths.

## Chapter 5: PASTA:

### Section: 5.1 Probability of Arrival:

The PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) property is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that relates the proportion of arrivals that see the system in a particular state to the proportion of time the system spends in that state. This property is essential in understanding the behavior of queueing systems and is widely used in advanced applications of queueing theory.

#### 5.1a Definition and Calculation of Probability of Arrival

The probability of arrival, denoted by $P_A$, is defined as the probability that a customer arrives at the system during a given time interval. In other words, it is the probability that the arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is greater than zero during that time interval. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
P_A = P(\lambda > 0)
$$

In many queueing models, the arrival process is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, which is a common assumption in many real-world scenarios. In such cases, the probability of arrival can be calculated using the Poisson probability mass function:

$$
P_A = \frac{(\lambda t)^n e^{-\lambda t}}{n!}
$$

Where $n$ is the number of arrivals during the time interval $t$. This formula can be used to calculate the probability of arrival for any given time interval in a Poisson arrival process.

The PASTA property states that the proportion of arrivals that see the system in a particular state is equal to the proportion of time the system spends in that state.

### Subsection: 5.1b Understanding Arrival Patterns in Queueing Systems

In this subsection, we will explore the different types of arrival patterns that can occur in queueing systems and how they affect the probability of arrival. Understanding these patterns is crucial in analyzing and optimizing queueing systems for various applications.

#### Poisson Arrival Process

As mentioned earlier, the Poisson arrival process is a common assumption in many queueing models. It is a stochastic process where arrivals occur independently and at a constant rate. This process is widely used in real-world scenarios such as telephone calls, customer arrivals at a store, and internet traffic.

In a Poisson arrival process, the probability of arrival is constant over time, and the arrivals are memoryless. This means that the probability of an arrival occurring in a given time interval is not affected by the number of arrivals that have occurred before. This property is known as the Markov property and is a key assumption in many queueing models.

#### Non-Poisson Arrival Process

While the Poisson arrival process is a common assumption, it is not always an accurate representation of real-world scenarios. In some cases, arrivals may not occur independently or at a constant rate, leading to a non-Poisson arrival process.

One example of a non-Poisson arrival process is a bursty arrival pattern, where arrivals occur in clusters or bursts rather than at a constant rate. This type of arrival pattern is common in internet traffic, where there may be periods of high activity followed by periods of low activity.

Another example is a self-similar arrival pattern, where the arrival rate varies over time but follows a certain pattern or trend. This type of arrival pattern is common in systems with long-range dependence, such as network traffic and stock market data.

#### Impact on Probability of Arrival

The type of arrival pattern in a queueing system can have a significant impact on the probability of arrival. In a Poisson arrival process, the probability of arrival is constant over time, making it easier to calculate and predict. However, in non-Poisson arrival processes, the probability of arrival may vary over time, making it more challenging to analyze and optimize the system.

In conclusion, understanding the different types of arrival patterns in queueing systems is crucial in accurately estimating the probability of arrival and predicting the behavior of the system. This knowledge is essential in optimizing queueing systems for various applications and improving their performance.

This property is essential in understanding the behavior of queueing systems and is widely used in advanced applications of queueing theory.

#### 5.2a Definition and Calculation of Probability of Service

The probability of service, denoted by $P_S$, is defined as the probability that a customer receives service during a given time interval. In other words, it is the probability that the service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is greater than zero during that time interval. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
P_S = P(\mu > 0)
$$

In many queueing models, the service process is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, which is a common assumption in many real-world scenarios. In such cases, the probability of service can be calculated using the Poisson probability mass function:

$$

#### 5.2b Analyzing Service Patterns in Queueing Systems

In this subsection, we will explore how the PASTA property can be used to analyze service patterns in queueing systems. By understanding the probability of service, we can gain insights into the behavior of the system and make informed decisions to improve its performance.

One key aspect of analyzing service patterns is understanding the relationship between the arrival rate and the service rate. In a Poisson service process, the arrival rate is equal to the service rate, which means that the probability of service is directly proportional to the arrival rate. This relationship is crucial in understanding the behavior of the system and optimizing its performance.

Another important aspect is understanding the impact of different service patterns on the system. For example, in a system with a high arrival rate and a low service rate, the probability of service will be low, which can lead to long waiting times and high queue lengths. On the other hand, in a system with a low arrival rate and a high service rate, the probability of service will be high, resulting in shorter waiting times and lower queue lengths.

By analyzing service patterns, we can identify potential bottlenecks in the system and make adjustments to improve its performance. For example, if we notice that the arrival rate is consistently higher than the service rate, we can increase the number of servers or improve the efficiency of the service process to reduce waiting times and queue lengths.

In conclusion, the PASTA property is a powerful tool in analyzing service patterns in queueing systems. By understanding the probability of service and its relationship with the arrival rate, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of the system and make informed decisions to optimize its performance.

### Section: 5.3 Probability of Time Average:

The PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) property is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that relates the proportion of arrivals that see the system in a particular state to the proportion of time the system spends in that state. This property is essential in understanding the behavior of queueing systems and is widely used in advanced applications of queueing theory.

#### 5.3a Definition and Calculation of Probability of Time Average

The probability of time average, denoted by $P_{TA}$, is defined as the probability that a customer spends a given amount of time in the system. In other words, it is the probability that the service time, denoted by $S$, is equal to a specific value. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
P_{TA} = P(S = t)
$$

In many queueing models, the service time is assumed to follow an exponential distribution, which is a common assumption in many real-world scenarios. In such cases, the probability of time average can be calculated using the exponential probability density function:

$$
P_{TA} = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}
$$

Where $\lambda$ is the service rate and $t$ is the specific time value. This formula can be used to calculate the probability of time average for any given time interval in an exponential service process.

In other words, the probability of time average is equal to the probability that the system is in a particular state. This property holds for any service process that follows an exponential distribution.

This property has significant implications in queueing theory, as it allows us to make accurate estimations of key performance metrics such as waiting times and queue lengths. By understanding the probability of time average, we can predict the behavior of queueing systems and optimize the system for better performance.

#### 5.3b Estimating Time Averages in Queueing Systems

In order to estimate the time averages in queueing systems, we must first understand the arrival process and the service process. The arrival process refers to the pattern of customer arrivals, while the service process refers to the pattern of customer service times. These two processes are essential in determining the behavior of a queueing system.

To estimate the time averages in a queueing system, we can use a variety of techniques such as simulation, mathematical models, and empirical data analysis. Simulation involves creating a computer model of the queueing system and running simulations to estimate the time averages. Mathematical models, such as the M/M/1 model, can also be used to estimate time averages in queueing systems. Finally, empirical data analysis involves collecting data from real-world queueing systems and using statistical methods to estimate the time averages.

It is important to note that the accuracy of these estimations depends on the assumptions made about the arrival and service processes. In cases where the assumptions do not hold, the estimations may not accurately reflect the behavior of the queueing system. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the assumptions and limitations of each estimation technique.

In conclusion, the probability of time average is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that allows us to estimate key performance metrics in queueing systems. By understanding the PASTA property and using appropriate estimation techniques, we can make informed decisions about system design and optimization.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction:

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory and its various applications. We have discussed the basic concepts of queues, such as arrival and service processes, queueing disciplines, and performance measures. We have also delved into more advanced topics, including multi-server systems, priority queues, and network queues. In this chapter, we will focus on systems with no overtaking and their exact solutions.

Systems with no overtaking refer to queueing systems where the order in which customers are served is strictly determined by their arrival time. This means that customers cannot overtake each other in the queue, and the first customer to arrive will be the first to be served. This type of system is commonly found in real-world scenarios, such as supermarkets, banks, and call centers.

In this chapter, we will explore the exact solutions for systems with no overtaking. We will discuss the mathematical models used to analyze these systems and how they differ from those used for systems with overtaking. We will also cover various performance measures, such as waiting time, queue length, and server utilization, and how they are affected by different system parameters.

Furthermore, we will examine different types of systems with no overtaking, including single-server and multi-server systems, and how their solutions differ. We will also discuss the impact of different queueing disciplines, such as first-come-first-served and last-come-first-served, on the performance of these systems.

Overall, this chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of systems with no overtaking and their exact solutions. It will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in applying queueing theory to real-world scenarios and for those looking to further their knowledge in this field. So let's dive in and explore the world of queueing systems with no overtaking. 


## Chapter 6: Systems with No Overtaking: Exact Solutions

### Section 6.1: FIFO Queueing System

In this section, we will focus on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) queueing system, which is a type of system with no overtaking. In a FIFO queue, the first customer to arrive will be the first to be served, regardless of their service time or priority. This type of system is also known as a first-come-first-served (FCFS) system.

#### 6.1a Definition and Analysis of FIFO Queueing System

The FIFO queueing system can be represented by the notation M/M/1, where M stands for Markovian, indicating that the arrival and service processes follow a Poisson distribution, and 1 represents a single-server system. This notation is commonly used in queueing theory to describe the characteristics of a queueing system.

To analyze the performance of a FIFO queueing system, we use the following performance measures:

- Waiting time: This is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a crucial measure of customer satisfaction and can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate.
- Queue length: This is the number of customers waiting in the queue at a given time. It is an essential measure of system congestion and can be calculated using the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers.
- Server utilization: This is the percentage of time that the server is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the efficiency of the system and can be calculated by dividing the service time by the total time.

To obtain the exact solutions for a FIFO queueing system, we use the birth-death process, which is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a queueing system over time. This model takes into account the arrival and service processes and their respective rates to determine the probability of different system states, such as the number of customers in the queue and the server status.

The birth-death process can be solved using the balance equations, which are a set of equations that represent the equilibrium conditions of the system. By solving these equations, we can obtain the steady-state probabilities of the different system states and use them to calculate the performance measures mentioned above.

In the next section, we will explore the exact solutions for a single-server FIFO queueing system and discuss how they differ from those of a multi-server system. We will also examine the impact of different queueing disciplines on the performance of a FIFO queueing system.


## Chapter 6: Systems with No Overtaking: Exact Solutions

### Section 6.1: FIFO Queueing System

In this section, we will focus on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) queueing system, which is a type of system with no overtaking. In a FIFO queue, the first customer to arrive will be the first to be served, regardless of their service time or priority. This type of system is also known as a first-come-first-served (FCFS) system.

#### 6.1a Definition and Analysis of FIFO Queueing System

The FIFO queueing system can be represented by the notation M/M/1, where M stands for Markovian, indicating that the arrival and service processes follow a Poisson distribution, and 1 represents a single-server system. This notation is commonly used in queueing theory to describe the characteristics of a queueing system.

To analyze the performance of a FIFO queueing system, we use the following performance measures:

- Waiting time: This is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a crucial measure of customer satisfaction and can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate.
- Queue length: This is the number of customers waiting in the queue at a given time. It is an essential measure of system congestion and can be calculated using the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers.
- Server utilization: This is the percentage of time that the server is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the efficiency of the system and can be calculated by dividing the service time by the total time.

### Subsection: 6.1b Performance Measures in FIFO Queueing System

In a FIFO queueing system, the performance measures mentioned above play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of the system. Let's take a closer look at each of these measures and how they can be calculated.

#### Waiting Time

As mentioned earlier, the waiting time is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a critical measure of customer satisfaction, as long waiting times can lead to dissatisfaction and potentially lost customers. To calculate the average waiting time in a FIFO queueing system, we can use Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate.

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

Where:
- W is the average waiting time
- L is the average queue length
- λ is the arrival rate

#### Queue Length

The queue length is the number of customers waiting in the queue at a given time. It is an essential measure of system congestion, as a high queue length can indicate that the system is overwhelmed and may need adjustments to improve its performance. To calculate the queue length in a FIFO queueing system, we can use the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers.

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

Where:
- L is the average queue length
- λ is the arrival rate
- μ is the service rate

#### Server Utilization

The server utilization is the percentage of time that the server is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the efficiency of the system, as a low server utilization can indicate that the system is not being fully utilized. To calculate the server utilization in a FIFO queueing system, we can divide the service time by the total time.

$$
U = \frac{S}{T}
$$

Where:
- U is the server utilization
- S is the service time
- T is the total time

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the FIFO queueing system is a type of system with no overtaking, where the first customer to arrive is the first to be served. To analyze its performance, we use measures such as waiting time, queue length, and server utilization. These measures can be calculated using formulas such as Little's Law and the queuing formula. Understanding these performance measures is crucial in designing and optimizing a FIFO queueing system for various applications.


## Chapter 6: Systems with No Overtaking: Exact Solutions

### Section 6.2: LIFO Queueing System

In this section, we will discuss the last-in-first-out (LIFO) queueing system, which is another type of system with no overtaking. In a LIFO queue, the last customer to arrive will be the first to be served, regardless of their service time or priority. This type of system is also known as a last-come-first-served (LCFS) system.

#### 6.2a Definition and Analysis of LIFO Queueing System

The LIFO queueing system can be represented by the notation M/M/1, where M stands for Markovian, indicating that the arrival and service processes follow a Poisson distribution, and 1 represents a single-server system. This notation is commonly used in queueing theory to describe the characteristics of a queueing system.

To analyze the performance of a LIFO queueing system, we use the same performance measures as in the FIFO system:

- Waiting time: This is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a crucial measure of customer satisfaction and can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate.
- Queue length: This is the number of customers waiting in the queue at a given time. It is an essential measure of system congestion and can be calculated using the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers.
- Server utilization: This is the percentage of time that the server is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the efficiency of the system and can be calculated by dividing the service time by the total time.

However, in a LIFO queueing system, the behavior of these performance measures may differ from that of a FIFO system. This is because the order in which customers are served is different, which can affect the waiting time and queue length.

### Subsection: 6.2b Performance Measures in LIFO Queueing System

In a LIFO queueing system, the performance measures mentioned above play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of the system. Let's take a closer look at each of these measures and how they can be calculated.

#### Waiting Time

In a LIFO queueing system, the waiting time for a customer is affected by the arrival rate, service rate, and the order in which customers are served. Unlike in a FIFO system, where the first customer to arrive is the first to be served, in a LIFO system, the last customer to arrive is the first to be served. This means that customers who arrive later may have a shorter waiting time compared to those who arrive earlier. The average waiting time can still be calculated using Little's Law, but the order in which customers are served must be taken into account.

#### Queue Length

Similar to the waiting time, the queue length in a LIFO system is also affected by the arrival rate, service rate, and the order in which customers are served. Customers who arrive later may have a shorter queue length compared to those who arrive earlier. The queuing formula can still be used to calculate the average queue length, but the order in which customers are served must be considered.

#### Server Utilization

The server utilization in a LIFO system is affected by the service time and the total time, just like in a FIFO system. However, the order in which customers are served can also affect the server utilization. If customers with longer service times are served first, the server utilization may be higher compared to a FIFO system. This is because the server is busy serving customers with longer service times, which can lead to a longer total time. 


## Chapter 6: Systems with No Overtaking: Exact Solutions

### Section 6.2: LIFO Queueing System

In this section, we will discuss the last-in-first-out (LIFO) queueing system, which is another type of system with no overtaking. In a LIFO queue, the last customer to arrive will be the first to be served, regardless of their service time or priority. This type of system is also known as a last-come-first-served (LCFS) system.

#### 6.2a Definition and Analysis of LIFO Queueing System

The LIFO queueing system can be represented by the notation M/M/1, where M stands for Markovian, indicating that the arrival and service processes follow a Poisson distribution, and 1 represents a single-server system. This notation is commonly used in queueing theory to describe the characteristics of a queueing system.

To analyze the performance of a LIFO queueing system, we use the same performance measures as in the FIFO system:

- Waiting time: This is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a crucial measure of customer satisfaction and can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate.
- Queue length: This is the number of customers waiting in the queue at a given time. It is an essential measure of system congestion and can be calculated using the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers.
- Server utilization: This is the percentage of time that the server is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the efficiency of the system and can be calculated by dividing the service time by the total time.

However, in a LIFO queueing system, the behavior of these performance measures may differ from that of a FIFO system. This is because the order in which customers are served is different, which can affect the waiting time and queue length.

### Subsection: 6.2b Performance Measures in LIFO Queueing System

In a LIFO queueing system, the performance measures mentioned above may have different values compared to a FIFO system. This is due to the different order in which customers are served. In this subsection, we will discuss the performance measures in more detail and how they are affected by the LIFO system.

#### Waiting Time

As mentioned earlier, the waiting time is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. In a LIFO system, the last customer to arrive will be the first to be served. This means that customers with shorter service times may have to wait longer if they arrive after customers with longer service times. This can result in a higher average waiting time compared to a FIFO system.

To calculate the waiting time in a LIFO system, we can use Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate. However, in a LIFO system, the queue length may not accurately represent the number of customers waiting in the queue, as the last customer to arrive may not be at the end of the queue. Therefore, the waiting time in a LIFO system may need to be calculated using a different approach.

#### Queue Length

The queue length in a LIFO system may also differ from that of a FIFO system. As mentioned earlier, the last customer to arrive may not be at the end of the queue, which can affect the accuracy of the queue length calculation. In addition, the queue length may also be affected by the service time of the last customer to arrive. If the last customer has a longer service time, the queue length may increase, and vice versa.

To calculate the queue length in a LIFO system, we can use the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers. However, as mentioned earlier, the queue length may not accurately represent the number of customers waiting in the queue in a LIFO system.

#### Server Utilization

The server utilization in a LIFO system may also differ from that of a FIFO system. In a LIFO system, the server may be idle for longer periods if the last customer to arrive has a longer service time. This can result in a lower server utilization compared to a FIFO system.

To calculate the server utilization in a LIFO system, we can divide the service time by the total time. However, as mentioned earlier, the service time may not accurately represent the time the server is busy in a LIFO system.

In conclusion, the performance measures in a LIFO queueing system may have different values compared to a FIFO system due to the different order in which customers are served. Therefore, it is essential to consider the specific characteristics of a LIFO system when analyzing its performance. 


## Chapter 6: Systems with No Overtaking: Exact Solutions

### Section 6.3: Priority Queueing System

In this section, we will discuss the priority queueing system, which is another type of system with no overtaking. In a priority queue, customers are served based on their priority level, rather than their arrival time or service time. This type of system is commonly used in situations where certain customers require immediate attention or have a higher importance.

#### 6.3a Definition and Analysis of Priority Queueing System

The priority queueing system can be represented by the notation M/M/c/c+K, where M stands for Markovian, indicating that the arrival and service processes follow a Poisson distribution, c represents the number of servers, and c+K represents the number of priority levels. This notation is commonly used in queueing theory to describe the characteristics of a queueing system.

To analyze the performance of a priority queueing system, we use the same performance measures as in the FIFO and LIFO systems:

- Waiting time: This is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a crucial measure of customer satisfaction and can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate.
- Queue length: This is the number of customers waiting in the queue at a given time. It is an essential measure of system congestion and can be calculated using the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers.
- Server utilization: This is the percentage of time that the server is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the efficiency of the system and can be calculated by dividing the service time by the total time.

However, in a priority queueing system, the behavior of these performance measures may differ from that of a FIFO or LIFO system. This is because the order in which customers are served is based on their priority level, which can affect the waiting time and queue length.

### Subsection: 6.3b Performance Measures in Priority Queueing System

In a priority queueing system, the performance measures are affected by the priority levels assigned to customers. The waiting time and queue length for high priority customers will be lower compared to those for low priority customers. This is because high priority customers are served first, reducing their waiting time and decreasing the queue length.

The server utilization in a priority queueing system can also be affected by the priority levels. If there are a large number of high priority customers, the server may be busy serving them, resulting in a higher server utilization. On the other hand, if there are a large number of low priority customers, the server may have more idle time, resulting in a lower server utilization.

To accurately analyze the performance of a priority queueing system, it is essential to consider the arrival rate and service rate for each priority level. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the system and allow for better decision making in terms of resource allocation and customer prioritization.

In this section, we will discuss the priority queueing system, which is another type of system with no overtaking. In a priority queue, customers are served based on their priority level, rather than their arrival time or service time. This type of system is commonly used in situations where certain customers require immediate attention or have a higher importance.

#### 6.3a Definition and Analysis of Priority Queueing System

The priority queueing system can be represented by the notation M/M/c/c+K, where M stands for Markovian, indicating that the arrival and service processes follow a Poisson distribution, c represents the number of servers, and c+K represents the number of priority levels. This notation is commonly used in queueing theory to describe the characteristics of a queueing system.

To analyze the performance of a priority queueing system, we use the same performance measures as in the FIFO and LIFO systems:

It is a crucial measure of customer satisfaction and can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate.
- Queue length: This is the number of customers waiting in the queue at a given time. It is an essential measure of system congestion and can be calculated using the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers.
- Server utilization: This is the percentage of time that the server is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the efficiency of the system and can be calculated by dividing the service time by the total time.

However, in a priority queueing system, the behavior of these performance measures may differ from that of a FIFO or LIFO system. This is because the order in which customers are served is based on their priority level, which can affect the waiting time, queue length, and server utilization.

### Subsection 6.3b: Performance Measures in Priority Queueing System

In a priority queueing system, the performance measures are influenced by the priority levels assigned to customers. This subsection will discuss the impact of priority levels on the waiting time, queue length, and server utilization.

#### Waiting Time

In a priority queueing system, customers with higher priority levels are served before customers with lower priority levels. This means that customers with higher priority levels will have a shorter waiting time compared to those with lower priority levels. However, this also means that customers with lower priority levels may experience longer waiting times, which can lead to dissatisfaction and potential loss of business.

To calculate the average waiting time in a priority queueing system, we can use Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate. However, in a priority queueing system, the arrival rate for each priority level may differ, making it necessary to calculate the average waiting time for each priority level separately.

#### Queue Length

Similar to the waiting time, the queue length in a priority queueing system is also influenced by the priority levels assigned to customers. Customers with higher priority levels will have a shorter queue length compared to those with lower priority levels. This is because they are served first, reducing the number of customers waiting in the queue.

To calculate the queue length in a priority queueing system, we can use the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers. However, as mentioned before, the arrival rate for each priority level may differ, making it necessary to calculate the queue length for each priority level separately.

#### Server Utilization

In a priority queueing system, the server utilization may also differ for each priority level. This is because customers with higher priority levels are served first, which can lead to a higher utilization rate for the server. On the other hand, customers with lower priority levels may experience longer waiting times, leading to a lower utilization rate for the server.

To calculate the server utilization in a priority queueing system, we can divide the service time by the total time. However, as with the waiting time and queue length, the service time for each priority level may differ, making it necessary to calculate the server utilization for each priority level separately.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the priority queueing system is a type of system with no overtaking, where customers are served based on their priority level. This system can be represented by the notation M/M/c/c+K and is commonly used in situations where certain customers require immediate attention or have a higher importance. The performance measures in a priority queueing system, such as waiting time, queue length, and server utilization, are influenced by the priority levels assigned to customers. Therefore, it is essential to consider the impact of priority levels when analyzing and optimizing the performance of a priority queueing system.


## Chapter 6: Systems with No Overtaking: Exact Solutions

### Section 6.4: Round Robin Queueing System

In this section, we will discuss the round robin queueing system, which is another type of system with no overtaking. In a round robin queue, customers are served in a cyclical manner, with each customer receiving a fixed amount of service time before being moved to the back of the queue. This type of system is commonly used in situations where all customers have equal priority and fairness in service is important.

#### 6.4a Definition and Analysis of Round Robin Queueing System

The round robin queueing system can be represented by the notation M/M/c, where M stands for Markovian, indicating that the arrival and service processes follow a Poisson distribution, and c represents the number of servers. This notation is commonly used in queueing theory to describe the characteristics of a queueing system.

To analyze the performance of a round robin queueing system, we use the same performance measures as in the FIFO and LIFO systems:

- Waiting time: This is the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a crucial measure of customer satisfaction and can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate.
- Queue length: This is the number of customers waiting in the queue at a given time. It is an essential measure of system congestion and can be calculated using the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers.
- Server utilization: This is the percentage of time that the server is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the efficiency of the system and can be calculated by dividing the service time by the total time.

However, in a round robin queueing system, the behavior of these performance measures may differ from that of a FIFO or LIFO system. This is because the cyclical nature of the system can lead to different waiting times and queue lengths for customers. Additionally, the server utilization may also be affected by the fixed service time given to each customer.

To further analyze the round robin queueing system, we can use the concept of virtual waiting time. This is the amount of time a customer would have to wait if they were to join the queue at the end of the current cycle. By considering the virtual waiting time, we can better understand the fairness of the system and its impact on customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, the round robin queueing system is a useful tool for managing queues in situations where fairness and equal priority are important. By understanding its characteristics and analyzing its performance measures, we can better design and optimize queueing systems for various applications.

- Server utilization: This is the percentage of time that the server is busy serving customers. It is a measure of the efficiency of the system and can be calculated by dividing the service time by the total time.

However, in a round robin queueing system, the behavior of these performance measures may differ from that of a FIFO or LIFO system. This is because the cyclical nature of the system can lead to different patterns of customer arrivals and service times. For example, in a FIFO system, the first customer in the queue is always the first to be served, but in a round robin system, this may not always be the case. This can affect the waiting time and queue length, as customers may have to wait longer if they are not at the front of the queue when their service time ends.

### Subsection: 6.4b Performance Measures in Round Robin Queueing System

In this subsection, we will explore the performance measures in a round robin queueing system in more detail. As mentioned before, the three main performance measures are waiting time, queue length, and server utilization. Let's take a closer look at each of these measures and how they are affected by the round robin system.

#### Waiting Time

The waiting time in a round robin queueing system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate. However, in a round robin system, the arrival rate may not be constant due to the cyclical nature of the system. This can lead to fluctuations in the waiting time, as customers may have to wait longer during peak arrival times and less during slower arrival times.

#### Queue Length

The queue length in a round robin system can also be calculated using the queuing formula, which takes into account the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers. However, in a round robin system, the arrival rate may not be constant, and the service rate may also vary due to the cyclical nature of the system. This can lead to fluctuations in the queue length, as the number of customers in the queue may increase or decrease depending on the arrival and service patterns.

#### Server Utilization

The server utilization in a round robin system can be calculated by dividing the service time by the total time. However, in a round robin system, the service time may also vary due to the cyclical nature of the system. This can lead to fluctuations in the server utilization, as the server may be busier during peak service times and less busy during slower service times.

In conclusion, the round robin queueing system is a unique type of system with no overtaking that can lead to different patterns of customer arrivals and service times. This can affect the performance measures of waiting time, queue length, and server utilization, making it important to carefully analyze and understand the behavior of this system. 


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored systems with no overtaking and have derived exact solutions for various queueing models. We have seen how the absence of overtaking can significantly impact the behavior of a queueing system, leading to different performance measures and queueing behaviors. By studying these models, we have gained a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of queueing theory and how they can be applied to real-world scenarios.

We began by examining the M/M/1 queue, which is a simple but powerful model that has been extensively studied in queueing theory. We derived the exact solution for this model and explored its properties, such as the mean queue length and mean waiting time. We then extended our analysis to the M/M/c queue, which allows for multiple servers and has a more complex solution. We also discussed the M/G/1 queue, which is a generalization of the M/M/1 queue and has a more realistic service time distribution.

Next, we delved into more advanced applications of queueing theory by studying the M/G/c queue and the G/G/1 queue. These models allow for both general arrival and service time distributions, making them more applicable to real-world scenarios. We derived the exact solutions for these models and discussed their implications on queueing behavior.

Finally, we explored the concept of priority queues, where certain customers are given priority over others. We discussed the M/G/1 priority queue and derived its exact solution, highlighting the differences in performance measures compared to the standard M/G/1 queue.

Overall, this chapter has provided a comprehensive overview of systems with no overtaking and their exact solutions. By understanding these models, we can better analyze and optimize queueing systems in various applications, such as telecommunications, transportation, and healthcare.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of systems with no overtaking in queueing theory. This refers to systems where the order in which customers arrive is preserved throughout the service process. This is in contrast to systems with overtaking, where customers may jump ahead in the queue based on certain criteria. We will focus on asymptotic solutions, which are mathematical approximations that are valid for large values of the system parameters. These solutions are useful in analyzing and understanding the behavior of complex queueing systems, as they provide simplified yet accurate representations of the system dynamics.

We will begin by discussing the fundamentals of systems with no overtaking, including the basic definitions and properties. This will provide a solid foundation for understanding the more advanced concepts that will be covered in this chapter. We will then delve into the asymptotic solutions for these systems, exploring various techniques and methods for obtaining these solutions. This will include the use of generating functions, Laplace transforms, and other mathematical tools.

One of the key applications of asymptotic solutions in systems with no overtaking is in the analysis of large-scale queueing systems. These systems are characterized by a large number of customers and servers, and traditional analytical methods may become computationally infeasible. Asymptotic solutions provide a way to simplify the analysis and gain insights into the behavior of these systems. We will explore several examples of such systems and how asymptotic solutions can be used to understand their performance.

Overall, this chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of systems with no overtaking and their asymptotic solutions. By the end, readers will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals and be equipped with the necessary tools to analyze and model complex queueing systems.

### Section: 7.1 Long-Run Average Queue Length:

In this section, we will explore the concept of long-run average queue length in systems with no overtaking. This is a key performance metric that measures the average number of customers waiting in the queue over a long period of time. It is an important measure of system efficiency and can be used to evaluate the performance of various queueing systems.

#### 7.1a Definition and Analysis of Long-Run Average Queue Length

The long-run average queue length, denoted by $L$, is defined as the expected value of the number of customers in the queue at any given time. It is a function of the arrival rate $\lambda$ and the service rate $\mu$, as well as the number of servers $s$ and the queue capacity $c$. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \int_{0}^{t} Q(t) dt
$$

where $Q(t)$ is the number of customers in the queue at time $t$. This definition is valid for both discrete and continuous time systems.

To analyze the long-run average queue length, we will use the concept of Little's Law. This law states that the long-run average queue length is equal to the product of the long-run average arrival rate and the long-run average waiting time. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $W$ is the long-run average waiting time. This law holds true for all queueing systems, regardless of their complexity.

Using Little's Law, we can derive an expression for the long-run average queue length in systems with no overtaking. Let $W_q$ be the long-run average waiting time for customers in the queue and $W_s$ be the long-run average waiting time for customers in service. Then, we can express the long-run average waiting time $W$ as:

$$
W = W_q + W_s
$$

Since there is no overtaking in these systems, the waiting time for customers in service is equal to the service time $1/\mu$. Therefore, we can rewrite the above equation as:

$$
W = W_q + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

Substituting this into Little's Law, we get:

$$
L = \lambda W_q + \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

This equation provides a simple yet powerful way to calculate the long-run average queue length in systems with no overtaking. It shows that the queue length is directly proportional to the arrival rate and inversely proportional to the service rate. This makes intuitive sense, as a higher arrival rate or a lower service rate would result in longer queues.

In the next section, we will explore various techniques for obtaining asymptotic solutions for the long-run average queue length in systems with no overtaking. These solutions will provide us with valuable insights into the behavior of these systems and help us analyze their performance in large-scale scenarios.

Then, we can express the long-run average waiting time $W$ as:

$$

Since there is no overtaking in these systems, the waiting time for customers in service is equal to the service time $1/\mu$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
W = W_q + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

To estimate the long-run average queue length, we need to calculate the long-run average waiting time $W$. This can be done by analyzing the queueing system using various techniques, such as Markov chains, queuing networks, or simulation. Once we have an estimate for $W$, we can use Little's Law to calculate the long-run average queue length $L$.

In the next subsection, we will focus on one specific technique for estimating the long-run average queue length in queueing systems with no overtaking.

### Section: 7.2 Long-Run Average Waiting Time:

In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of long-run average waiting time in systems with no overtaking. This metric measures the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue over a long period of time. It is a crucial measure of system performance and can be used to evaluate the efficiency of various queueing systems.

#### 7.2a Definition and Analysis of Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time, denoted by $W$, is defined as the expected value of the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue.

$$

where $W(t)$ is the waiting time of a customer at time $t$. This definition is valid for both discrete and continuous time systems.

To analyze the long-run average waiting time, we can use Little's Law once again. We know that the long-run average waiting time is equal to the long-run average queue length divided by the long-run average arrival rate. Therefore, we can express it as:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

This equation shows that the long-run average waiting time is directly proportional to the long-run average queue length. This means that as the queue length increases, so does the waiting time. This relationship is important to consider when designing and optimizing queueing systems.

In conclusion, the long-run average waiting time is a crucial performance metric in systems with no overtaking. It measures the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue and is influenced by various factors such as arrival rate, service rate, number of servers, and queue capacity.

It is a function of the arrival rate $\lambda$ and the service rate $\mu$, as well as the number of servers $s$ and the queue capacity $c$. This metric is important because it provides insight into the overall efficiency of a queueing system. A shorter average waiting time indicates that customers are spending less time waiting in the queue, which can lead to higher customer satisfaction and potentially higher profits for the system.

To analyze the long-run average waiting time, we can use the concept of the steady-state distribution. This distribution represents the probability of a customer being in the system for a given amount of time. By integrating this distribution over all possible waiting times, we can calculate the expected value of the waiting time, which is the long-run average waiting time.

#### 7.2b Estimating Long-Run Average Waiting Time in Queueing Systems

There are several methods for estimating the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems. One common method is the use of the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which is based on the concept of the Pollaczek-Khinchine transform. This formula allows us to calculate the long-run average waiting time using the system's arrival rate, service rate, and the probability of a customer being in the system for a given amount of time.

Another method is the use of simulation techniques. By simulating the behavior of a queueing system over a long period of time, we can estimate the long-run average waiting time. This method is particularly useful for complex systems where analytical solutions are not feasible.

In conclusion, the long-run average waiting time is a crucial metric in queueing theory that measures the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is influenced by various factors such as arrival rate, service rate, and system capacity, and can be estimated using analytical formulas or simulation techniques. By understanding and optimizing this metric, we can improve the efficiency and performance of queueing systems in various real-world applications.

The long-run average waiting time, denoted by $W$, is defined as the expected value of the amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is a function of the arrival rate $\lambda$ and the service rate $\mu$, as well as the number of servers $s$ and the queue capacity $c$. In other words, it represents the average amount of time a customer has to wait in the queue before being served.

To analyze the long-run average waiting time, we can use the concept of Little's Law, which states that the long-run average waiting time is equal to the product of the long-run average arrival rate and the long-run average queue length. This means that if we can calculate the long-run average queue length, we can also determine the long-run average waiting time.

In systems with no overtaking, the long-run average queue length can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate and $\mu$ is the service rate. This formula assumes that the arrival rate is less than the service rate, which is a common assumption in many real-world systems.

Using this formula, we can see that as the arrival rate approaches the service rate, the long-run average queue length becomes infinitely large. This is because as more customers arrive at the system, the queue will continue to grow without bound. This is known as the critical point, and it represents the point at which the system becomes unstable.

On the other hand, as the arrival rate decreases, the long-run average queue length also decreases. This means that the system becomes more stable and efficient, as there are fewer customers waiting in the queue.

In summary, the long-run average waiting time is a crucial metric in queueing systems with no overtaking. It represents the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue and can be calculated using Little's Law and the formula for long-run average queue length. As the arrival rate and service rate change, the long-run average waiting time also changes, providing valuable insights into the stability and efficiency of the system.

By calculating the area under this distribution curve, we can determine the average waiting time.

#### 7.2b Factors Affecting Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time is affected by several factors, including the arrival rate, service rate, number of servers, and queue capacity. As the arrival rate increases, the waiting time also increases, as there are more customers entering the system. Similarly, a higher service rate leads to a decrease in waiting time, as customers are served faster. The number of servers also plays a role, as a higher number of servers can serve more customers simultaneously, reducing the waiting time. Finally, the queue capacity can affect the waiting time, as a larger queue can accommodate more customers and reduce the waiting time.

### Section: 7.3 Asymptotic Behavior of Queueing Systems:

In this section, we will explore the asymptotic behavior of queueing systems, which refers to the behavior of the system as time goes to infinity. This is an important concept in queueing theory, as it allows us to understand the long-term performance of a system and make predictions about its behavior.

#### 7.3a Definition of Asymptotic Behavior

The asymptotic behavior of a queueing system refers to the behavior of the system as time goes to infinity. In other words, it is the long-term behavior of the system. This behavior is often characterized by certain performance metrics, such as the long-run average queue length and the long-run average waiting time.

#### 7.3b Understanding the Limiting Behavior of Queueing Systems

To understand the limiting behavior of queueing systems, we can use the concept of stability. A queueing system is considered stable if the number of customers in the system does not grow infinitely over time. In other words, the system is able to handle the incoming traffic without becoming overwhelmed. By analyzing the stability of a queueing system, we can gain insight into its asymptotic behavior.

In addition, we can also use the concept of heavy traffic to understand the limiting behavior of queueing systems. Heavy traffic refers to a situation where the arrival rate is close to or exceeds the service rate. In this case, the system is under high stress and its behavior may differ from that of a system under normal traffic conditions. By studying the behavior of a queueing system under heavy traffic, we can gain a better understanding of its asymptotic behavior.

Overall, understanding the limiting behavior of queueing systems is crucial for predicting their long-term performance and making informed decisions about system design and management.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction:

In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of priority and polling systems in queueing theory. These systems are commonly used in various real-world applications, such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and transportation systems. Priority systems involve giving certain customers or tasks higher priority over others, while polling systems involve serving multiple queues in a cyclical manner. Both of these systems have their own unique characteristics and challenges, and understanding them is crucial for designing efficient and effective queueing systems.

We will begin by discussing the fundamentals of priority and polling systems, including the different types of priorities and polling strategies. We will then explore the mathematical models used to analyze these systems, such as the M/G/1 priority system and the cyclic polling model. These models will help us understand the behavior of these systems and make predictions about their performance.

Next, we will move on to more advanced applications of priority and polling systems.

### Section: 8.1 Priority Queues:

Priority queues are a type of queueing system where certain customers or tasks are given higher priority over others. This means that they are served before other customers or tasks, regardless of their arrival time. Priority queues are commonly used in various real-world applications, such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and transportation systems, where certain tasks or customers may be more urgent or important than others.

#### 8.1a Definition and Analysis of Priority Queues

A priority queue can be defined as a queueing system where each customer or task is assigned a priority level. The customer or task with the highest priority is served first, followed by the next highest priority, and so on. This means that customers or tasks with lower priority may have to wait longer to be served, even if they arrived earlier than higher priority customers or tasks.

To analyze the performance of a priority queue, we can use the M/G/1 priority system model. This model is an extension of the M/G/1 queueing model, where the arrival process follows a Poisson distribution and the service time follows a general distribution. In the M/G/1 priority system, we introduce the concept of priority levels, where each customer is assigned a priority level and the service rate may vary depending on the priority level.

Using this model, we can calculate important performance metrics such as the average waiting time, average queue length, and average waiting time for each priority level. This allows us to understand the impact of different priority levels on the overall performance of the system.

In addition to the M/G/1 priority system, there are other mathematical models that can be used to analyze priority queues, such as the M/G/c priority system and the G/G/1 priority system. These models take into account multiple servers and general service time distributions, respectively.

### Section: 8.1 Priority Queues:

Priority queues are a fundamental concept in queueing theory, allowing for the prioritization of certain customers or tasks over others. In this section, we will explore the performance evaluation of priority queues, specifically using the M/G/1 priority system model.

#### 8.1b Performance Evaluation of Priority Queues

The M/G/1 priority system model is an extension of the M/G/1 queueing model, where the arrival process follows a Poisson distribution and the service time follows a general distribution. In the M/G/1 priority system, we introduce the concept of priority levels, where each customer is assigned a priority level and the service rate may vary depending on the priority level.

To analyze the performance of a priority queue, we can use the M/G/1 priority system model to calculate important performance metrics such as the average waiting time, average queue length, and average waiting time for each priority level. This allows us to understand the impact of different priority levels on the overall performance of the system.

In the M/G/1 priority system, the arrival rate is denoted by $\lambda$ and the service rate for each priority level $i$ is denoted by $\mu_i$. The probability of a customer being assigned to priority level $i$ is denoted by $p_i$. Using Little's Law, we can calculate the average waiting time for each priority level as:

$$
W_i = \frac{L_i}{\lambda_i} = \frac{1}{\mu_i - \lambda_i}
$$

where $L_i$ is the average queue length for priority level $i$. This equation shows that the average waiting time for a priority level is inversely proportional to the difference between the service rate and arrival rate for that level. This means that as the difference between the two rates increases, the average waiting time decreases.

In addition to the M/G/1 priority system, there are other mathematical models that can be used to analyze priority queues. The M/G/c priority system takes into account multiple servers, while the G/G/1 priority system considers general service time distributions. These models can provide more accurate results for real-world applications, but the M/G/1 priority system is a good starting point for understanding the fundamentals of priority queues.

In conclusion, the performance evaluation of priority queues is crucial in understanding the impact of different priority levels on the overall performance of a system. The M/G/1 priority system model allows us to calculate important metrics and gain insights into the behavior of priority queues. 


### Section: 8.2 Preemptive Scheduling:

Preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling in queueing systems where a customer or task with a higher priority can interrupt or preempt the service of a lower priority customer or task. This type of scheduling is commonly used in real-world systems where certain tasks or customers require immediate attention or have strict deadlines.

#### 8.2a Definition and Analysis of Preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

In preemptive scheduling, the priority of a customer or task is determined by a predefined priority rule. This rule can be based on factors such as urgency, importance, or deadline. When a higher priority customer or task arrives, it is immediately given service, even if there are lower priority customers or tasks currently being served.

To analyze the performance of preemptive scheduling in queueing systems, we can use the M/G/1 priority system model as a starting point. However, we must also consider the impact of preemption on the system's performance.

One important metric to consider is the average waiting time for each priority level. In preemptive scheduling, the average waiting time for a higher priority level is expected to be lower than that of a lower priority level. This is because higher priority customers or tasks are given immediate service, reducing their waiting time.

Another important metric is the average queue length for each priority level. In preemptive scheduling, the average queue length for a higher priority level is expected to be shorter than that of a lower priority level. This is because higher priority customers or tasks are given immediate service, reducing the number of customers or tasks waiting in the queue.

However, preemptive scheduling can also have a negative impact on the system's performance. The constant interruption of lower priority customers or tasks can lead to increased overhead and processing time, ultimately affecting the overall efficiency of the system.

To mitigate this issue, it is important to carefully consider the priority rule used in preemptive scheduling. The rule should be designed to minimize the number of interruptions while still prioritizing important or urgent customers or tasks.

In addition to the M/G/1 priority system, there are other mathematical models that can be used to analyze preemptive scheduling in queueing systems. The M/G/c priority system with preemption takes into account multiple servers and the possibility of preemption, providing a more accurate representation of real-world systems.

In conclusion, preemptive scheduling is a powerful tool in queueing theory that allows for the prioritization of important or urgent customers or tasks. However, it is important to carefully consider the impact of preemption on the system's performance and choose a suitable priority rule to optimize the system's efficiency.


### Section: 8.2 Preemptive Scheduling:

Preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling in queueing systems where a customer or task with a higher priority can interrupt or preempt the service of a lower priority customer or task. This type of scheduling is commonly used in real-world systems where certain tasks or customers require immediate attention or have strict deadlines.

#### 8.2a Definition and Analysis of Preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

In preemptive scheduling, the priority of a customer or task is determined by a predefined priority rule. This rule can be based on factors such as urgency, importance, or deadline. When a higher priority customer or task arrives, it is immediately given service, even if there are lower priority customers or tasks currently being served.

To analyze the performance of preemptive scheduling in queueing systems, we can use the M/G/1 priority system model as a starting point. However, we must also consider the impact of preemption on the system's performance.

#### 8.2b Impact of Preemptive Scheduling on System Performance

Preemptive scheduling can have both positive and negative impacts on the performance of a queueing system. On one hand, it can reduce the average waiting time and queue length for higher priority customers or tasks. This is because they are given immediate service, reducing their waiting time and the number of customers or tasks waiting in the queue.

On the other hand, preemptive scheduling can also have a negative impact on the system's performance. The constant interruption of lower priority customers or tasks can lead to increased overhead and processing time. This can ultimately affect the overall efficiency of the system.

To mitigate this negative impact, it is important to carefully consider the priority rule used in preemptive scheduling. The rule should be designed to balance the urgency of higher priority tasks with the need to minimize interruptions and overhead for lower priority tasks.

In addition, the system should also have mechanisms in place to handle situations where a large number of high priority tasks arrive simultaneously. This can include implementing a priority queue or using techniques such as time slicing to ensure that lower priority tasks are not completely neglected.

Overall, preemptive scheduling can be a powerful tool in managing queueing systems, but it must be carefully implemented and monitored to ensure optimal performance. In the next section, we will explore another type of scheduling - non-preemptive scheduling - and compare its impact on system performance.


### Section: 8.3 Non-preemptive Scheduling:

Non-preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling in queueing systems where a customer or task is not interrupted or preempted by a higher priority customer or task. This means that once a customer or task has started receiving service, it will not be interrupted until it has been completed. Non-preemptive scheduling is commonly used in systems where all customers or tasks are considered to have equal priority.

#### 8.3a Definition and Analysis of Non-preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

In non-preemptive scheduling, the priority of a customer or task is not taken into consideration. This means that all customers or tasks are treated equally and are served in the order they arrive. This type of scheduling is often used in systems where fairness is important, such as in customer service centers or online ticketing systems.

To analyze the performance of non-preemptive scheduling in queueing systems, we can use the M/G/1 queueing model. In this model, customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and are served by a single server with service time distribution $G$. The performance measures of interest are the average waiting time and the average queue length.

#### 8.3b Performance Measures for Non-preemptive Scheduling

The average waiting time for a customer in a non-preemptive scheduling system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate. In other words, the longer the queue, the longer the average waiting time.

The average queue length can be calculated using the M/G/1 queueing model. The formula for the average queue length is given by:

$$
L_q = \frac{\rho^2}{1-\rho} \cdot \frac{1}{2(1-\rho)}
$$

where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ is the utilization factor, with $\mu$ being the service rate.

#### 8.3c Advantages and Disadvantages of Non-preemptive Scheduling

One of the main advantages of non-preemptive scheduling is its simplicity. Since all customers or tasks are treated equally, there is no need to consider priority rules or make complex decisions. This makes it easier to implement and manage in real-world systems.

However, non-preemptive scheduling also has some disadvantages. One major disadvantage is that it can lead to longer waiting times for higher priority customers or tasks. This is because they are not given priority over lower priority customers or tasks, and may have to wait longer in the queue.

### Subsection: 8.3d Comparison with Preemptive Scheduling

Compared to preemptive scheduling, non-preemptive scheduling has a more equal distribution of service among customers or tasks. In preemptive scheduling, higher priority customers or tasks are given immediate service, while lower priority customers or tasks may have to wait longer. This can lead to a less fair distribution of service.

However, non-preemptive scheduling may also result in longer waiting times for higher priority customers or tasks. This can be a disadvantage in systems where certain customers or tasks require immediate attention.

### Subsection: 8.3e Applications of Non-preemptive Scheduling

Non-preemptive scheduling is commonly used in systems where fairness is important, such as in customer service centers, online ticketing systems, and resource allocation in computer systems. It is also used in systems where all customers or tasks are considered to have equal priority, such as in first-come-first-served systems.

### Subsection: 8.3f Conclusion

Non-preemptive scheduling is a simple and fair approach to scheduling in queueing systems. It treats all customers or tasks equally and can be easily implemented in real-world systems. However, it may result in longer waiting times for higher priority customers or tasks, making it less suitable for systems where immediate attention is required. 


### Section: 8.3 Non-preemptive Scheduling:

Non-preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling in queueing systems where a customer or task is not interrupted or preempted by a higher priority customer or task. This means that once a customer or task has started receiving service, it will not be interrupted until it has been completed. Non-preemptive scheduling is commonly used in systems where all customers or tasks are considered to have equal priority.

The performance measures of interest are the average waiting time and the average queue length.

#### 8.3b Performance Measures for Non-preemptive Scheduling

The average waiting time for a customer in a non-preemptive scheduling system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate. In other words, the longer the queue, the longer the average waiting time.

The average queue length can be calculated using the M/G/1 queueing model. The formula for the average queue length is given by:

$$
L_q = \frac{\rho^2}{1-\rho} \cdot \frac{1}{2(1-\rho)}
$$

where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ is the utilization factor, with $\mu$ being the service rate.

#### 8.3c Advantages and Disadvantages of Non-preemptive Scheduling

One of the main advantages of non-preemptive scheduling is its fairness. By treating all customers or tasks equally, it ensures that no one is given preferential treatment. This can be important in systems where customer satisfaction is a top priority.

However, non-preemptive scheduling also has its disadvantages. One major disadvantage is that it may not be the most efficient way to schedule tasks. Since all tasks are treated equally, higher priority tasks may have to wait longer if they arrive after lower priority tasks. This can lead to longer waiting times and potentially lower overall productivity.

### Subsection: 8.3b Evaluating the Effectiveness of Non-preemptive Scheduling

To evaluate the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling, we can compare it to other scheduling methods, such as preemptive scheduling. Preemptive scheduling allows for higher priority tasks to interrupt and preempt lower priority tasks, potentially leading to a more efficient use of resources.

One way to evaluate the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling is to look at the average waiting time and queue length in comparison to preemptive scheduling. If the average waiting time and queue length are significantly longer in non-preemptive scheduling, it may indicate that preemptive scheduling would be a more effective method for that particular system.

Another factor to consider is the type of tasks or customers in the system. If there are a mix of high and low priority tasks, non-preemptive scheduling may not be the most effective method. However, if all tasks are of equal importance, non-preemptive scheduling may be a better choice.

In conclusion, non-preemptive scheduling has its advantages and disadvantages, and its effectiveness depends on the specific system and tasks involved. It is important for system designers to carefully consider the priorities and goals of their system when choosing a scheduling method.


### Section: 8.4 Polling Systems:

Polling systems are a type of scheduling in queueing systems where a server serves multiple queues in a cyclic manner. This means that the server switches between queues, serving one customer at a time from each queue until all customers have been served. Polling systems are commonly used in situations where there are multiple queues with different priorities, and the server needs to allocate its time efficiently among them.

#### 8.4a Definition and Analysis of Polling Systems

In polling systems, the server follows a predetermined order in serving the queues. This order can be based on various factors such as queue length, priority, or a round-robin approach. The server spends a fixed amount of time serving each queue before moving on to the next one. This type of scheduling is often used in systems where there are multiple types of customers with different priorities, such as in a hospital emergency room or a call center.

To analyze the performance of polling systems in queueing systems, we can use the M/G/1 queueing model. In this model, customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and are served by a single server with service time distribution $G$. The performance measures of interest are the average waiting time and the average queue length.

#### 8.4b Performance Measures for Polling Systems

The average waiting time for a customer in a polling system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the arrival rate. However, in polling systems, the average queue length is not simply the sum of the individual queue lengths, as the server is serving multiple queues simultaneously. The formula for the average queue length in a polling system is given by:

$$
L_q = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \cdot \frac{1}{2(1-\rho)}
$$

where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ is the utilization factor, with $\mu$ being the service rate.

#### 8.4c Advantages and Disadvantages of Polling Systems

One of the main advantages of polling systems is that they allow for efficient allocation of server time among multiple queues with different priorities. This can lead to improved overall system performance and customer satisfaction. Additionally, polling systems can handle a larger number of customers compared to non-preemptive scheduling, as the server is not tied up serving a single queue at a time.

However, polling systems also have some disadvantages. The predetermined order of serving queues may not always be optimal, leading to longer waiting times for certain customers. Additionally, the fixed amount of time spent serving each queue may not be enough for customers with longer service times, resulting in longer overall waiting times. Furthermore, the complexity of analyzing and optimizing polling systems can be a challenge.

$$

where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ is the utilization factor, with $\mu$ being the service rate.

#### 8.4c Advanced Performance Evaluation of Polling Systems

In addition to the average waiting time and average queue length, there are other performance measures that can be used to evaluate the efficiency of polling systems. These include the throughput, which is the number of customers served per unit time, and the system utilization, which is the percentage of time the server is busy serving customers.

To calculate the throughput of a polling system, we can use the formula:

$$
X = \frac{1}{T}
$$

where $T$ is the total time taken to serve all customers in the system. This can be calculated by summing the service times for each customer in the system.

The system utilization can be calculated by dividing the total service time by the total time in the system. This can be expressed as:

$$
U = \frac{T_s}{T}
$$

where $T_s$ is the total service time and $T$ is the total time in the system.

By analyzing these performance measures, we can determine the efficiency of a polling system and make improvements to optimize its performance.

### Section: 9.1 M/M/s Queueing System:

Multiserver queues can be classified into different types based on the arrival and service processes. One of the most commonly studied types is the M/M/s queueing system, where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times follow an exponential distribution. In this section, we will define and analyze the M/M/s queueing system in detail.

#### 9.1a Definition and Analysis of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is a multiserver queueing system with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. The notation M/M/s represents the characteristics of this system, where the first M stands for Markovian arrivals, the second M stands for Markovian service times, and s represents the number of servers.

To better understand the M/M/s queueing system, let us consider an example of a call center with s customer service representatives (servers). Customers arrive at the call center according to a Poisson process with an arrival rate of λ customers per unit time. The service times for each customer follow an exponential distribution with a mean of 1/μ units of time. The call center operates on a first-come, first-served basis, and customers who cannot be served immediately join the queue.

The performance of the M/M/s queueing system can be evaluated using various performance measures, such as the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. These measures can be calculated using the following equations:

$$
L = \frac{\rho^s}{s!(1-\rho)}\frac{\lambda}{\mu} \tag{1}
$$

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda} \tag{2}
$$

$$
L_q = \frac{\rho^s}{s!(1-\rho)^2}\frac{\lambda}{\mu} \tag{3}
$$

Where:
- L is the average number of customers in the system
- W is the average waiting time
- L_q is the average queue length
- ρ is the traffic intensity, given by ρ = λ/μs
- λ is the arrival rate
- μ is the service rate
- s is the number of servers

From these equations, we can see that the performance of the M/M/s queueing system is heavily dependent on the traffic intensity ρ. When ρ is close to 1, the system is heavily loaded, and the average number of customers in the system and the queue length will be high. On the other hand, when ρ is close to 0, the system is lightly loaded, and the average waiting time will be low.

In addition to these performance measures, the M/M/s queueing system can also be analyzed using the probability distribution of the number of customers in the system and the queue length. These distributions can be derived using the birth-death process and can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the queueing system.

In conclusion, the M/M/s queueing system is an important and widely studied type of multiserver queueing system. Its analysis and performance evaluation can provide valuable insights into the behavior of complex queueing systems and help in optimizing their performance. In the next section, we will explore the impact of different server configurations on the M/M/s queueing system and how to optimize these systems for better performance.

Multiserver queues can be classified into different types based on the arrival and service processes. One of the most commonly studied types is the M/M/s queueing system, where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times follow an exponential distribution. This type of queueing system is widely used in various industries, such as telecommunications, healthcare, and manufacturing.

#### 9.1b Performance Measures in M/M/s Queueing System

To evaluate the performance of an M/M/s queueing system, we can use various performance measures, such as the average waiting time, average queue length, and server utilization. These measures provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the queueing system and can help in identifying areas for improvement.

The average waiting time, denoted by $W$, is the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a crucial measure as it directly affects customer satisfaction and can impact the overall performance of the system. The average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$, is equal to the arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, multiplied by the average waiting time, i.e., $L = \lambda W$.

Another important measure is the average queue length, denoted by $L_q$, which represents the average number of customers waiting in the queue at any given time. This measure is closely related to the average waiting time and can be calculated using the formula $L_q = \frac{\lambda^2}{\mu(\mu - \lambda)}$, where $\mu$ is the service rate.

The server utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is another crucial measure that represents the percentage of time the server is busy serving customers. It is calculated by dividing the average service time, denoted by $S$, by the average interarrival time, denoted by $1/\lambda$, i.e., $\rho = \frac{S}{1/\lambda} = \lambda S$. A high server utilization can lead to longer waiting times and queues, while a low utilization may indicate underutilization of resources.

In conclusion, the M/M/s queueing system is a widely used and studied type of multiserver queue that can provide valuable insights into the performance of various real-world systems. By understanding and analyzing its performance measures, we can optimize these systems for better efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Multiserver queues can be classified into different types based on the arrival and service processes. One of the most commonly studied types is the M/M/s queueing system, where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times follow an exponential distribution. In this section, we will define and analyze this type of queueing system.

#### 9.1a Definition and Analysis of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is a multiserver queueing system with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. It is characterized by having s servers that can serve customers simultaneously. The arrival rate of customers is denoted by λ, and the service rate of each server is denoted by μ. The system can have an infinite number of waiting spaces, and customers are served on a first-come, first-served basis.

To analyze the performance of the M/M/s queueing system, we can use the following performance measures:

- Utilization factor (ρ): the proportion of time that all servers are busy.
- Average number of customers in the system (L): the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue.
- Average waiting time in the system (W): the average time a customer spends in the system, including both service time and waiting time.
- Probability of n customers in the system (Pn): the probability that there are n customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue.

Using Little's Law, we can also relate the average number of customers in the system (L) to the average waiting time (W) and the arrival rate (λ):

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

To calculate these performance measures, we can use the following formulas:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{s\mu}
$$

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} + \frac{\rho^{s+1}}{1-\rho}
$$

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

$$
Pn = \frac{\rho^n}{s!(1-\rho)}\left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)^n
$$

These formulas can help us understand the behavior of the M/M/s queueing system and make predictions about its performance. In the next section, we will explore the impact of different server configurations on the performance of this type of queueing system.

Multiserver queues are characterized by having multiple servers that can serve customers simultaneously. This type of queueing system is commonly found in various real-world scenarios, such as call centers, supermarkets, and transportation systems.

We will also explore the impact of different server configurations on the queueing process and how to optimize these systems for better performance. Additionally, we will discuss the challenges and limitations of multiserver queues and their applications in different industries.

### Section: 9.1 M/M/s Queueing System:

Multiserver queues can be classified into different types based on the arrival and service processes. One of the most commonly studied types is the M/M/s queueing system, where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times follow an exponential distribution. This type of queueing system is often used to model scenarios where customers arrive randomly and are served in a first-come, first-served manner by a fixed number of servers.

#### 9.1a Characteristics of M/M/s Queueing System

In an M/M/s queueing system, the arrival rate of customers is denoted by λ, and the service rate of each server is denoted by μ. The number of servers is represented by s. The system is said to be in a steady state when the arrival rate is equal to the service rate, i.e. λ = sμ. In this case, the average number of customers in the system, denoted by L, can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \cdot \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where ρ is the utilization factor, given by ρ = λ/μs. This formula shows that the average number of customers in the system is directly proportional to the arrival rate and the utilization factor, and inversely proportional to the difference between the arrival and service rates.

#### 9.1b Performance Measures in M/M/s Queueing System

The performance of an M/M/s queueing system can be evaluated using various measures, such as the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. These measures can be calculated using the following formulas:

- Average number of customers in the system: L = λ/μ
- Average waiting time: W = L/λ = 1/μ
- Average queue length: Lq = L - ρ

These measures provide valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the queueing system and can be used to identify areas for improvement.

### Section: 9.2 M/G/s Queueing System:

Another commonly studied type of multiserver queueing system is the M/G/s queueing system, where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times follow a general distribution. This type of queueing system is often used to model scenarios where the service times are not exponentially distributed, such as in call centers where the length of a call can vary.

#### 9.2a Characteristics of M/G/s Queueing System

In an M/G/s queueing system, the arrival rate of customers is denoted by λ, and the service rate of each server is denoted by μ. The number of servers is represented by s. The system is said to be in a steady state when the arrival rate is equal to the service rate, i.e. λ = sμ. In this case, the average number of customers in the system, denoted by L, can be calculated using Little's Law:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot W
$$

where W is the average waiting time. This formula shows that the average number of customers in the system is directly proportional to the arrival rate and the average waiting time.

#### 9.2b Performance Measures in M/G/s Queueing System

The performance of an M/G/s queueing system can be evaluated using the same measures as the M/M/s queueing system, i.e. the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. However, in this case, these measures may need to be calculated using simulation or approximation techniques, as the service times are not exponentially distributed.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the M/G/s queueing system, which is a commonly studied type of multiserver queueing system. We have discussed its characteristics and performance measures, and how they differ from the M/M/s queueing system. In the next section, we will delve into the analysis techniques for M/G/s queueing systems and how to optimize their performance.

### Section: 9.1 M/M/s Queueing System:

Multiserver queues can be classified into different types based on the arrival and service processes. One of the most commonly studied types is the M/M/s queueing system, where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times follow an exponential distribution. In this section, we will define and analyze this type of queueing system.

#### 9.1a Definition and Analysis of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is a multiserver queueing system with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. The notation M/M/s represents the characteristics of this system, where M stands for Markovian (memoryless) arrivals and service times, and s represents the number of servers.

To analyze the performance of this system, we can use the following parameters:

- $\lambda$: Arrival rate (customers per unit time)
- $\mu$: Service rate (customers per unit time)
- $s$: Number of servers
- $\rho$: Utilization factor ($\rho = \frac{\lambda}{s\mu}$)
- $L$: Average number of customers in the system
- $L_q$: Average number of customers in the queue
- $W$: Average waiting time in the system
- $W_q$: Average waiting time in the queue

Using Little's Law, we can relate the average number of customers in the system to the arrival rate and the average waiting time:

$$L = \lambda W$$

Similarly, the average number of customers in the queue can be related to the arrival rate and the average waiting time in the queue:

$$L_q = \lambda W_q$$

To calculate the performance measures of the M/M/s queueing system, we can use the following formulas:

- $L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}\frac{\rho^s}{s!(1-\rho/s)}$
- $L_q = \frac{\rho^{s+1}}{s!(s-1)(1-\rho/s)}$
- $W = \frac{L}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}$
- $W_q = \frac{L_q}{\lambda} = \frac{\rho}{\mu - \lambda}$

These formulas can be derived using the birth-death process and the steady-state equations for the M/M/s queueing system. They provide a way to calculate the performance measures of this system for different values of $\lambda$, $\mu$, and $s$.

In conclusion, the M/M/s queueing system is a commonly studied type of multiserver queueing system that can be used to model various real-world scenarios. Its performance measures can be calculated using the formulas mentioned above, making it a useful tool for analyzing and optimizing queueing systems with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times.

Multiserver queues can be classified into different types based on the arrival and service processes. One of the most commonly studied types is the M/M/s queueing system, where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times follow an exponential distribution. This type of queueing system is widely used in various industries, such as telecommunications, healthcare, and manufacturing.

#### 9.1a Characteristics of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is characterized by having s identical servers that can serve customers simultaneously. Customers arrive at the system according to a Poisson process with a rate of λ, and each server can serve customers at a rate of μ. The service times are exponentially distributed, and the queue has an infinite capacity. The arrival and service processes are assumed to be independent of each other.

#### 9.1b Performance Measures in M/M/s Queueing System

The performance of a queueing system can be evaluated using various measures, such as the average waiting time, average queue length, and system utilization. In the M/M/s queueing system, these measures can be calculated using the following equations:

- Average waiting time: $$W_q = \frac{\rho}{\mu(1-\rho)}$$
- Average queue length: $$L_q = \frac{\rho^2}{1-\rho}$$
- System utilization: $$\rho = \frac{\lambda}{s\mu}$$

where ρ is the traffic intensity, defined as the ratio of arrival rate to service rate.

#### 9.1c Analysis of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system can be analyzed using various techniques, such as the Markov chain approach and the Little's law. These techniques allow us to calculate the performance measures and understand the behavior of the system under different conditions. Additionally, simulation and optimization methods can also be used to analyze and improve the performance of the M/M/s queueing system.

### Section: 9.2 M/D/s Queueing System:

Another commonly studied type of multiserver queueing system is the M/D/s queueing system, where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times follow a deterministic distribution. This type of queueing system is often used in industries where the service times are fixed, such as banking and retail.

#### 9.2a Characteristics of M/D/s Queueing System

The M/D/s queueing system is similar to the M/M/s system, except for the service times, which are now fixed and known. This means that the service rate for each server is constant and does not vary. The arrival and service processes are still assumed to be independent of each other.

#### 9.2b Performance Measures in M/D/s Queueing System

The performance measures for the M/D/s queueing system are similar to those of the M/M/s system, except for the average waiting time, which can be calculated using the following equation:

- Average waiting time: $$W_q = \frac{\rho}{s\mu(1-\rho)}$$

#### 9.2c Analysis of M/D/s Queueing System

The analysis techniques for the M/D/s queueing system are similar to those of the M/M/s system, with the addition of the deterministic service times. This means that the Markov chain approach and Little's law can still be used, but the simulation and optimization methods may need to be modified to account for the fixed service times.

### Section: 9.3 G/M/s Queueing System:

The G/M/s queueing system is a more general type of multiserver queueing system, where arrivals follow a general distribution and service times follow an exponential distribution. This type of queueing system is often used in industries where the arrival process is not well-defined, such as healthcare and transportation.

#### 9.3a Characteristics of G/M/s Queueing System

The G/M/s queueing system is similar to the M/M/s system, except for the arrival process, which can follow any general distribution. This means that the arrival rate may vary over time, leading to a more dynamic queueing process. The service times are still exponentially distributed, and the arrival and service processes are assumed to be independent of each other.

#### 9.3b Performance Measures in G/M/s Queueing System

The performance measures for the G/M/s queueing system are similar to those of the M/M/s system, except for the average waiting time, which can be calculated using the following equation:

- Average waiting time: $$W_q = \frac{\rho}{\mu(1-\rho)}\frac{E[A^2]}{2(1-\rho)}$$

where E[A^2] is the second moment of the arrival distribution.

#### 9.3c Analysis of G/M/s Queueing System

The analysis techniques for the G/M/s queueing system are similar to those of the M/M/s system, with the addition of the general arrival process. This means that the Markov chain approach and Little's law can still be used, but the simulation and optimization methods may need to be modified to account for the general arrival process.

### Conclusion

Multiserver queues are a more complex and advanced type of queueing system that are commonly found in various real-world scenarios. In this section, we have discussed the characteristics, performance measures, and analysis techniques for three types of multiserver queues: M/M/s, M/D/s, and G/M/s.

In this section, we will define and analyze the M/M/s queueing system.

#### 9.1a Definition and Analysis of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is a multiserver queueing system with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. The notation M/M/s represents the characteristics of this system, where the first M stands for Markovian arrivals, the second M stands for Markovian service times, and s represents the number of servers.

To analyze the performance of the M/M/s queueing system, we can use the following parameters:

- $\lambda$: the arrival rate of customers
- $\mu$: the service rate of each server
- s: the number of servers
- $\rho$: the utilization factor, calculated as $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{s\mu}$
- $L$: the average number of customers in the system
- $L_q$: the average number of customers in the queue
- $W$: the average time a customer spends in the system
- $W_q$: the average time a customer spends in the queue

Using these parameters, we can derive the following equations for the M/M/s queueing system:

- $P_0 = \frac{1}{\sum_{n=0}^{s-1}\frac{(\lambda/\mu)^n}{n!} + \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^s}{s!(1-\rho)}}$: the probability of having 0 customers in the system
- $P_n = \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^n}{n!}P_0$: the probability of having n customers in the system
- $L = \lambda W$: Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average time spent in the system
- $L_q = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}P_0$: the average number of customers in the queue
- $W = \frac{L}{\lambda}$: the average time a customer spends in the system
- $W_q = \frac{L_q}{\lambda}$: the average time a customer spends in the queue

By analyzing these equations, we can gain insights into the performance of the M/M/s queueing system and make informed decisions about its design and optimization. In the next section, we will explore another type of multiserver queueing system, the G/G/s queueing system, and compare it to the M/M/s system.

One of the most commonly studied types is the M/M/s queueing system, where arrivals follow a Poisson process and service times follow an exponential distribution. This type of queueing system is often used to model scenarios where customers arrive randomly and are served by multiple servers with identical service rates.

In the M/M/s queueing system, the arrival rate is denoted by $\lambda$, and the service rate of each server is denoted by $\mu$. The number of servers is denoted by $s$, and the system is assumed to have an infinite capacity. The notation for this type of queueing system is M/M/s/$\infty$.

### Subsection: 9.1b Performance Measures in M/M/s Queueing System

To analyze the performance of the M/M/s queueing system, we can use various performance measures, such as the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. These measures can help us understand the efficiency and effectiveness of the queueing system and identify areas for improvement.

One of the key performance measures in the M/M/s queueing system is the average waiting time, denoted by $W$. This is the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
W = \frac{\rho}{\mu(1-\rho)} \cdot \frac{1}{s-\rho}
$$

where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{s\mu}$ is the utilization factor, representing the proportion of time the servers are busy. This formula assumes that the arrival rate is less than the total service rate, which is a common assumption in queueing theory.

Another important performance measure is the average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$. This includes both the customers being served and those waiting in the queue. It can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} + \frac{\rho^s}{1-\rho} \cdot \frac{s}{s-\rho}
$$

Similarly, we can also calculate the average queue length, denoted by $L_q$, which only includes the customers waiting in the queue. It can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
L_q = \frac{\rho^s}{1-\rho} \cdot \frac{s}{(s-\rho)^2}
$$

These performance measures can help us evaluate the efficiency of the M/M/s queueing system and make informed decisions to improve its performance. In the next section, we will explore how these measures can be applied to real-world scenarios and the impact of different server configurations on the queueing process.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we explored the concept of multiserver queues and how they can be used to improve the efficiency and performance of queueing systems. We began by discussing the basics of multiserver queues, including the different types and configurations. We then delved into the mathematical models and analysis techniques used to study these queues, such as Little's Law and the Erlang-C formula. Additionally, we explored various real-world applications of multiserver queues, including call centers, transportation systems, and computer networks.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of balancing server utilization and customer waiting time in multiserver queues. By properly configuring the number of servers and understanding the arrival and service rates, we can optimize the performance of these systems. We also learned about the trade-offs between cost and performance, as adding more servers can reduce waiting time but also increase operational costs.

Overall, multiserver queues are a powerful tool in queueing theory that can be applied to a wide range of real-world scenarios. By understanding the fundamentals and advanced applications of these queues, we can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of various systems and processes.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime. This regime is named after two prominent researchers, Ward Whitt and William Halfin, who made significant contributions to the field of queueing theory. Queueing theory is a branch of applied mathematics that studies the behavior of waiting lines, or queues, and the systems that create them. It is a fundamental tool for understanding and analyzing various real-world scenarios, such as traffic flow, customer service, and telecommunication networks.

The Halfin-Whitt regime is a special case in queueing theory that occurs when the arrival rate of customers is high, and the service time is short. In this regime, the queueing system exhibits unique characteristics that differ from other regimes, such as the heavy-traffic regime or the light-traffic regime. The behavior of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime has been extensively studied and has led to the development of various advanced applications.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamentals of the Halfin-Whitt regime, including its defining characteristics and mathematical models. We will also explore the various applications of this regime, such as its use in performance analysis and optimization of queueing systems. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a thorough understanding of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime and their practical applications. 


### Section: 10.1 Heavy-Traffic Limits:

In queueing theory, the Halfin-Whitt regime is a special case that occurs when the arrival rate of customers is high and the service time is short. This regime is named after two prominent researchers, Ward Whitt and William Halfin, who made significant contributions to the field of queueing theory. In this section, we will explore the concept of heavy-traffic limits in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

#### 10.1a Definition and Analysis of Heavy-Traffic Limits

In the Halfin-Whitt regime, the arrival rate of customers, denoted by $\lambda$, is close to the service rate, denoted by $\mu$. This means that the system is operating at high traffic levels, and the queue is constantly filled with customers. In this regime, the queueing system exhibits unique characteristics that differ from other regimes, such as the heavy-traffic regime or the light-traffic regime.

To better understand the behavior of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime, we can analyze the heavy-traffic limits. These limits are defined as the maximum arrival rate of customers that the system can handle while maintaining a stable queue. In other words, it is the highest traffic level at which the system can operate without the queue growing infinitely long.

To calculate the heavy-traffic limits, we can use the Halfin-Whitt formula, given by:

$$
\lambda_c = \frac{\mu}{1-\rho}
$$

where $\lambda_c$ is the critical arrival rate and $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ is the traffic intensity. This formula shows that as the traffic intensity approaches 1, the critical arrival rate approaches infinity. This means that the system can handle a higher arrival rate when operating at high traffic levels.

The heavy-traffic limits have important implications for the performance of queueing systems. For example, if the arrival rate exceeds the critical arrival rate, the queue will grow infinitely long, and the system will become unstable. This can lead to long waiting times for customers and a decrease in overall system efficiency.

In addition to stability, the heavy-traffic limits also play a crucial role in the optimization of queueing systems. By understanding the maximum arrival rate that the system can handle, we can make adjustments to improve system performance and increase efficiency.

In conclusion, heavy-traffic limits are an essential concept in the Halfin-Whitt regime. They define the maximum arrival rate that a queueing system can handle while maintaining stability and play a crucial role in system optimization. In the next section, we will explore the various applications of this regime in performance analysis and optimization of queueing systems.

This regime is named after two prominent researchers, Ward Whitt and William Halfin, who made significant contributions to the field of queueing theory. In this section, we will explore the concept of heavy-traffic limits in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

#### 10.1a Definition and Analysis of Heavy-Traffic Limits

In the Halfin-Whitt regime, the arrival rate of customers, denoted by $\lambda$, is close to the service rate, denoted by $\mu$. This means that the system is operating at high traffic levels, and the queue is constantly filled with customers. In this regime, the queueing system exhibits unique characteristics that differ from other regimes, such as the heavy-traffic regime or the light-traffic regime.

To better understand the behavior of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime, we can analyze the heavy-traffic limits. These limits are defined as the maximum arrival rate of customers that the system can handle while maintaining a stable queue. In other words, it is the highest traffic level at which the system can operate without the queue growing infinitely long.

To calculate the heavy-traffic limits, we can use the Halfin-Whitt formula, given by:

$$
\lambda_c = \frac{\mu}{1-\rho}
$$

where $\lambda_c$ is the critical arrival rate and $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ is the traffic intensity. This formula shows that as the traffic intensity approaches 1, the critical arrival rate approaches infinity. This means that the system can handle a higher arrival rate when operating at high traffic levels.

The heavy-traffic limits have important implications for the performance of queueing systems. For example, if the arrival rate exceeds the critical arrival rate, the queue will grow infinitely long, and the system will become unstable. This can lead to long waiting times for customers and a decrease in overall system efficiency. Therefore, it is crucial for queueing systems to operate within the heavy-traffic limits to maintain stability and optimal performance.

#### 10.1b Understanding Queueing Systems in Heavy-Traffic Regime

In the previous section, we discussed the definition and analysis of heavy-traffic limits in the Halfin-Whitt regime. Now, let's delve deeper into understanding the behavior of queueing systems in this regime.

One key characteristic of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime is the phenomenon of congestion. As the arrival rate approaches the critical arrival rate, the queue becomes increasingly congested, and the waiting times for customers become longer. This is due to the fact that the system is operating at its maximum capacity, and any additional arrivals will result in longer queues and increased waiting times.

Another important aspect to consider in the heavy-traffic regime is the concept of stability. As mentioned earlier, if the arrival rate exceeds the critical arrival rate, the system becomes unstable and the queue grows infinitely long. This can have severe consequences for the system, such as increased customer dissatisfaction and potential loss of revenue. Therefore, it is crucial for queueing systems to operate within the heavy-traffic limits to maintain stability.

In addition to stability, the heavy-traffic regime also has implications for resource allocation. In this regime, the system is operating at its maximum capacity, and any additional resources allocated to the system may not result in a significant improvement in performance. This is because the system is already operating at its maximum potential, and any additional resources may not be utilized efficiently.

Overall, understanding queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime is crucial for optimizing system performance and maintaining stability. In the next section, we will explore some advanced applications of queueing theory in the Halfin-Whitt regime, such as the use of control policies to manage congestion and improve system efficiency.


### Section: 10.2 Fluid Limit:

In the previous section, we explored the concept of heavy-traffic limits in the Halfin-Whitt regime. These limits provide valuable insights into the behavior of queues in high traffic levels. However, as the traffic intensity approaches 1, the heavy-traffic limits become less accurate and may not fully capture the dynamics of the queueing system. This is where the concept of fluid limit comes into play.

#### 10.2a Definition and Analysis of Fluid Limit

The fluid limit is a mathematical concept that describes the behavior of a queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt regime as the traffic intensity approaches 1. It is a continuous-time approximation of the discrete-time queueing system, where the arrival and service processes are modeled as continuous functions. This allows us to analyze the system using differential equations, which provide a more accurate representation of the system's behavior in high traffic levels.

To understand the fluid limit, let us consider a queueing system with a single server and a finite buffer of size $N$. As the traffic intensity approaches 1, the queue length becomes large, and the discrete-time process can be approximated by a continuous-time process. This means that the arrival and service processes can be modeled as continuous functions of time, denoted by $\lambda(t)$ and $\mu(t)$, respectively.

Using this continuous-time approximation, we can derive the fluid limit for the queue length, denoted by $Q(t)$. This is given by the following differential equation:

$$
\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = \lambda(t) - \mu(t)Q(t)
$$

This equation describes the rate of change of the queue length at time $t$. The first term on the right-hand side represents the arrival rate, while the second term represents the service rate. As the traffic intensity approaches 1, the arrival rate becomes equal to the service rate, and the queue length reaches a steady-state value.

The fluid limit provides a more accurate representation of the queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt regime compared to the heavy-traffic limits. It takes into account the continuous nature of the arrival and service processes, which can have a significant impact on the system's behavior in high traffic levels.

In conclusion, the fluid limit is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It provides a more accurate representation of the system's behavior compared to the heavy-traffic limits and allows for the use of differential equations to analyze the system's dynamics.

This allows us to analyze the system using differential equations, which can provide more insights into the system's dynamics.

#### 10.2b Modeling Queueing Systems using Fluid Limit

In this subsection, we will explore how we can use the fluid limit to model and analyze queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. As mentioned earlier, the fluid limit provides a continuous-time approximation of the discrete-time queueing system. This means that we can use differential equations to model and analyze the system's behavior.

Let us consider a queueing system with a single server and a finite buffer of size $N$. Using the fluid limit, we can model the queue length, denoted by $Q(t)$, as a function of time. The differential equation for $Q(t)$ is given by:

$$
\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = \lambda(t) - \mu(t)Q(t)
$$

This equation describes the rate of change of the queue length at time $t$. The first term on the right-hand side represents the arrival rate, while the second term represents the service rate. As the traffic intensity approaches 1, the arrival rate becomes equal to the service rate, and the queue length reaches a steady-state value.

Using this differential equation, we can analyze the behavior of the queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt regime. We can determine the steady-state queue length, the average waiting time, and other performance metrics of interest. This allows us to gain a better understanding of the system's behavior and make informed decisions to improve its performance.

In addition to analyzing the system's behavior, the fluid limit also allows us to design and optimize queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. By manipulating the arrival and service rates, we can control the system's behavior and optimize its performance. This can be done by solving the differential equation for $Q(t)$ and finding the optimal values for the arrival and service rates.

In conclusion, the fluid limit is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It provides a more accurate representation of the system's behavior compared to heavy-traffic limits and allows for more in-depth analysis and optimization. By understanding and utilizing the fluid limit, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of queueing systems and improve their performance. 


### Section: 10.3 Diffusion Limit:

In the previous section, we explored the concept of fluid limit in the Halfin-Whitt regime. This limit provides a more accurate representation of the behavior of queues in high traffic levels compared to the heavy-traffic limit. However, as the traffic intensity approaches 1, the fluid limit may also become less accurate. This is where the concept of diffusion limit comes into play.

#### 10.3a Definition and Analysis of Diffusion Limit

The diffusion limit is a mathematical concept that describes the behavior of a queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt regime as the traffic intensity approaches 1. It is a continuous-time approximation of the fluid limit, where the arrival and service processes are modeled as stochastic processes. This allows us to analyze the system using stochastic differential equations, which provide a more accurate representation of the system's behavior in high traffic levels.

To understand the diffusion limit, let us consider a queueing system with a single server and a finite buffer of size $N$. As the traffic intensity approaches 1, the queue length becomes large, and the fluid limit may not fully capture the dynamics of the system. This is because the fluid limit assumes that the arrival and service processes are deterministic, which may not be the case in real-world scenarios.

To overcome this limitation, the diffusion limit takes into account the stochastic nature of the arrival and service processes. This is done by modeling the arrival and service rates as stochastic processes, denoted by $\Lambda(t)$ and $\Mu(t)$, respectively. These processes are assumed to follow a Brownian motion with mean and variance proportional to the traffic intensity.

Using this stochastic approximation, we can derive the diffusion limit for the queue length, denoted by $Q(t)$. This is given by the following stochastic differential equation:

$$
dQ(t) = \Lambda(t)dt - \Mu(t)Q(t)dt + \sqrt{\Mu(t)Q(t)}dW(t)
$$

where $W(t)$ is a Wiener process. This equation describes the stochastic evolution of the queue length at time $t$. The first two terms on the right-hand side represent the deterministic arrival and service rates, while the third term represents the stochastic fluctuations in the queue length.

The diffusion limit provides a more accurate representation of the behavior of the queueing system in high traffic levels compared to the fluid limit. It takes into account the stochastic nature of the arrival and service processes, which can significantly impact the system's behavior as the traffic intensity approaches 1.

The diffusion limit is a mathematical concept that describes the behavior of a queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt regime as the traffic intensity approaches 1. It is a continuous-time approximation of the fluid limit, where the arrival and service processes are modeled as stochastic processes. This allows us to analyze the system using stochastic differential equations, which provide a more accurate representation of the system's behavior in high traffic levels.

Using this stochastic approximation, we can derive the diffusion limit for the queue length, denoted by $Q(t)$. This is given by the following stochastic differential equation:

$$
dQ(t) = \Lambda(t)dt - \Mu(t)Q(t)dt + \sqrt{\Mu(t)Q(t)}dW(t)
$$

where $W(t)$ is a Wiener process. This equation describes the evolution of the queue length over time, taking into account the stochastic nature of the arrival and service processes. By solving this equation, we can obtain the expected value and variance of the queue length, which provides a more accurate representation of the system's behavior in high traffic levels.

#### 10.3b Approximating Queueing Systems using Diffusion Limit

The diffusion limit can also be used to approximate more complex queueing systems, such as multi-server systems or systems with multiple queues. In these cases, the stochastic differential equation for the queue length may become more complex, but the same principles apply. By modeling the arrival and service processes as stochastic processes, we can obtain a more accurate representation of the system's behavior in high traffic levels.

One example of using the diffusion limit to approximate a multi-server queueing system is the M/M/c queue. This is a queueing system with a single queue, multiple servers, and Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. In the Halfin-Whitt regime, the fluid limit for this system is given by the following differential equation:

$$
\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = \Lambda - c\Mu Q(t)
$$

where $\Lambda$ is the arrival rate and $\Mu$ is the service rate. However, as the traffic intensity approaches 1, this fluid limit may not accurately capture the behavior of the system. By using the diffusion limit, we can model the arrival and service rates as stochastic processes and obtain a more accurate representation of the system's behavior.

In conclusion, the diffusion limit is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. By taking into account the stochastic nature of the arrival and service processes, it provides a more accurate representation of the system's behavior in high traffic levels. This makes it a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the performance of queueing systems in real-world scenarios.


### Section: 10.4 Stationary Distribution:

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of diffusion limit and how it provides a more accurate representation of the behavior of queues in high traffic levels compared to the fluid limit. However, the diffusion limit still has its limitations, especially when it comes to analyzing the long-term behavior of a queueing system. This is where the concept of stationary distribution comes into play.

#### 10.4a Definition and Analysis of Stationary Distribution

The stationary distribution is a probability distribution that describes the long-term behavior of a queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It is a steady-state distribution that the system approaches as time goes to infinity. This distribution is important because it allows us to analyze the performance of a queueing system in the long run, which is crucial for real-world applications.

To understand the stationary distribution, let us consider a queueing system with a single server and a finite buffer of size $N$. In the Halfin-Whitt regime, the arrival and service processes are modeled as stochastic processes, denoted by $\Lambda(t)$ and $\Mu(t)$, respectively. These processes are assumed to follow a Brownian motion with mean and variance proportional to the traffic intensity.

Using this stochastic approximation, we can derive the stationary distribution for the queue length, denoted by $Q$. This is given by the following probability density function:

$$
f(Q) = \frac{\Lambda}{\Mu} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \Mu Q}} \cdot e^{-\frac{(\Lambda - \Mu Q)^2}{2\Mu Q}}
$$

This distribution allows us to analyze the long-term behavior of the queue length in the Halfin-Whitt regime. By calculating the mean and variance of this distribution, we can determine important performance metrics such as the average queue length and the probability of the queue being full.

Furthermore, the stationary distribution can also be used to analyze the stability of a queueing system. If the mean of the distribution is less than the buffer size $N$, then the system is stable and the queue length will not grow indefinitely. On the other hand, if the mean is greater than $N$, the system is unstable and the queue length will continue to grow, potentially leading to congestion and delays.

In conclusion, the stationary distribution is a crucial concept in queueing theory as it allows us to analyze the long-term behavior and stability of a queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt regime. By understanding this distribution, we can make informed decisions when designing and managing queueing systems in real-world applications.

Furthermore, the stationary distribution can also be used to analyze the stability of a queueing system. In order for a queueing system to be stable, the arrival rate must be less than the service rate. This can be determined by analyzing the stationary distribution and ensuring that the mean queue length is finite.

#### 10.4b Estimating Stationary Distribution in Queueing Systems

In order to estimate the stationary distribution in a queueing system, we can use simulation techniques. By simulating the arrival and service processes, we can generate a large number of samples and use them to approximate the stationary distribution. This can be done by tracking the queue length over time and calculating the average queue length and the probability of the queue being full.

Another approach to estimating the stationary distribution is through analytical methods. This involves using mathematical techniques to derive the distribution based on the system parameters and assumptions. While this method may be more accurate, it can also be more complex and time-consuming.

Overall, understanding the stationary distribution is crucial for analyzing the long-term behavior and stability of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. By estimating this distribution, we can gain valuable insights into the performance of these systems and make informed decisions for real-world applications.

## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory and its various applications in different fields. We have discussed single-server and multi-server queueing systems, as well as different queueing disciplines such as FIFO, LIFO, and Priority queues. In this chapter, we will delve into the concept of Open Jackson Networks, which is an extension of the basic Jackson Network model. 

Open Jackson Networks are a type of queueing network that consists of multiple interconnected queues, where customers can enter and exit the system at any point. This type of network is commonly used to model complex real-world systems such as computer networks, transportation systems, and telecommunication networks. The analysis of Open Jackson Networks is crucial in understanding the performance and behavior of these systems, and it has numerous practical applications in optimizing their efficiency and resource allocation.

In this chapter, we will cover the key concepts and techniques used in analyzing Open Jackson Networks. We will start by discussing the basic structure and characteristics of these networks, including the arrival and service processes, as well as the routing and scheduling policies. We will then move on to explore the fundamental performance measures of Open Jackson Networks, such as the average queue length, waiting time, and system throughput. 

Furthermore, we will also discuss the stability and stability conditions of Open Jackson Networks, which are essential in determining the long-term behavior of these systems. We will also cover advanced topics such as the mean value analysis and the use of Markov chains in analyzing these networks. Finally, we will conclude this chapter by discussing some real-world applications of Open Jackson Networks and their impact on various industries.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Open Jackson Networks and their applications. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in analyzing and optimizing the performance of complex queueing systems, making it a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals in the field of queueing theory. 


## Chapter 11: Open Jackson Networks:

### Section 11.1 Jackson Networks:

Open Jackson Networks are a type of queueing network that consists of multiple interconnected queues, where customers can enter and exit the system at any point. This type of network is commonly used to model complex real-world systems such as computer networks, transportation systems, and telecommunication networks. The analysis of Open Jackson Networks is crucial in understanding the performance and behavior of these systems, and it has numerous practical applications in optimizing their efficiency and resource allocation.

### Subsection 11.1a Definition and Analysis of Jackson Networks

In this subsection, we will define and analyze the structure and characteristics of Jackson Networks. A Jackson Network is a queueing network that consists of N interconnected queues, where customers can enter and exit the system at any point. The arrival process at each queue is assumed to be Poisson, and the service time at each queue is exponentially distributed. The routing and scheduling policies determine the movement of customers between queues, and these policies can vary depending on the specific system being modeled.

To analyze a Jackson Network, we first need to define the following parameters:

- $\lambda_i$: The arrival rate at queue $i$.
- $\mu_i$: The service rate at queue $i$.
- $p_{ij}$: The probability that a customer leaving queue $i$ will enter queue $j$.
- $N$: The total number of queues in the network.

Using these parameters, we can calculate the steady-state probabilities of each queue being in a certain state, denoted by $P_i(n)$, where $i$ represents the queue and $n$ represents the number of customers in that queue. These probabilities can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
P_i(n) = \frac{(\lambda_i/\mu_i)^n}{n!}P_i(0)
$$

where $P_i(0)$ is the probability of the queue being empty. 

The average queue length, $L_i$, and the average waiting time, $W_i$, can also be calculated using the following formulas:

$$
L_i = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}nP_i(n)
$$

$$
W_i = \frac{L_i}{\lambda_i}
$$

Furthermore, the system throughput, denoted by $X$, can be calculated as the sum of the arrival rates at each queue:

$$
X = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_i
$$

The stability of a Jackson Network is determined by the stability condition, which states that the total arrival rate at the network must be less than the total service rate, i.e., $\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_i < \sum_{i=1}^{N}\mu_i$. If this condition is not met, the queues will continue to grow indefinitely, and the system will become unstable.

In addition to these fundamental performance measures, the stability and stability conditions of Jackson Networks are also crucial in determining the long-term behavior of these systems. The stability condition can be checked by calculating the traffic intensity, denoted by $\rho$, which is defined as the ratio of the total arrival rate to the total service rate:

$$
\rho = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mu_i}
$$

If $\rho < 1$, the system is stable, and if $\rho > 1$, the system is unstable.

Advanced techniques such as mean value analysis and the use of Markov chains can also be applied to analyze Jackson Networks. Mean value analysis is a method used to calculate the performance measures of a queueing network by considering the average number of customers in each queue. Markov chains, on the other hand, can be used to model the behavior of customers in the network and determine the probabilities of different states.

In conclusion, Jackson Networks are a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing complex real-world systems. By understanding the fundamental concepts and techniques used in analyzing these networks, we can gain valuable insights into the performance and behavior of these systems and make informed decisions to optimize their efficiency and resource allocation. In the next section, we will explore the stability and stability conditions of Open Jackson Networks and their practical applications in various industries.

The analysis of Open Jackson Networks is crucial in understanding the performance and behavior of these systems, and it has numerous practical applications in optimizing their efficiency and resource allocation.

### Subsection 11.1b Modeling Network Performance using Jackson Networks

In this subsection, we will explore how Jackson Networks can be used to model and analyze the performance of complex systems. By understanding the structure and characteristics of these networks, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of real-world systems and make informed decisions to improve their efficiency.

#### 11.1b.1 Defining Network Parameters

To model a system using a Jackson Network, we first need to define the parameters that characterize the network. These parameters include the arrival rate, service rate, and routing policies. The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda_i$, represents the rate at which customers enter queue $i$. Similarly, the service rate, denoted by $\mu_i$, represents the rate at which customers are served at queue $i$. These rates are assumed to follow a Poisson and exponential distribution, respectively.

The routing policies determine the movement of customers between queues in the network. This can vary depending on the specific system being modeled. For example, in a computer network, the routing policy may be based on the shortest path algorithm, while in a transportation system, it may be based on the destination of the customer.

#### 11.1b.2 Calculating Steady-State Probabilities

Using the defined parameters, we can calculate the steady-state probabilities of each queue being in a certain state. These probabilities, denoted by $P_i(n)$, represent the probability of there being $n$ customers in queue $i$. They can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
P_i(n) = \frac{(\lambda_i/\mu_i)^n}{n!}P_i(0)
$$

where $P_i(0)$ is the probability of the queue being empty. These probabilities are crucial in understanding the behavior of the system and can be used to calculate other performance metrics.

#### 11.1b.3 Analyzing Network Performance

Once we have calculated the steady-state probabilities, we can use them to analyze the performance of the network. The average queue length, denoted by $L_i$, represents the average number of customers in queue $i$. Similarly, the average waiting time, denoted by $W_i$, represents the average time a customer spends waiting in queue $i$. These metrics can be calculated using the following formulas:

$$
L_i = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} nP_i(n)
$$

$$
W_i = \frac{L_i}{\lambda_i}
$$

By analyzing these metrics, we can gain insights into the efficiency and resource allocation of the system. This information can be used to make informed decisions to improve the performance of the system.

The analysis of Jackson Networks has numerous practical applications in optimizing the performance of real-world systems. For example, in a computer network, understanding the behavior of the network can help in optimizing the routing policies to reduce network congestion and improve overall efficiency. In a transportation system, it can help in optimizing the scheduling of vehicles to reduce waiting times for customers.

In this subsection, we have explored how Jackson Networks can be used to model and analyze the performance of complex systems. By defining network parameters, calculating steady-state probabilities, and analyzing network performance, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of real-world systems and make informed decisions to improve their efficiency.

### Section: 11.2 Routing Probability:

Open Jackson Networks are a type of queueing network that consists of multiple interconnected queues, where customers can enter and exit the system at any point. This type of network is commonly used to model complex real-world systems such as computer networks, transportation systems, and telecommunication networks. The analysis of Open Jackson Networks is crucial in understanding the performance and behavior of these systems, and it has numerous practical applications in optimizing their efficiency and resource allocation.

### Subsection: 11.2a Definition and Calculation of Routing Probability

In this subsection, we will define and calculate the routing probability in Open Jackson Networks. The routing probability, denoted by $P_{ij}$, represents the probability that a customer who enters queue $i$ will eventually move to queue $j$. This probability is an essential factor in understanding the flow of customers through the network and can help us optimize the routing policies to improve system performance.

To calculate the routing probability, we first need to define the network parameters, including the arrival rate, service rate, and routing policies. The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda_i$, represents the rate at which customers enter queue $i$. Similarly, the service rate, denoted by $\mu_i$, represents the rate at which customers are served at queue $i$. These rates are assumed to follow a Poisson and exponential distribution, respectively.

The routing policies determine the movement of customers between queues in the network. This can vary depending on the specific system being modeled. For example, in a computer network, the routing policy may be based on the shortest path algorithm, while in a transportation system, it may be based on the destination of the customer.

Once the network parameters are defined, we can use the following formula to calculate the routing probability:

$$
P_{ij} = \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i + \mu_i} \cdot \frac{\mu_j}{\mu_j + \lambda_j}
$$

This formula takes into account the arrival and service rates at both queues $i$ and $j$, as well as the probability of a customer moving from queue $i$ to queue $j$. By calculating the routing probability for each possible combination of queues in the network, we can gain a better understanding of the flow of customers and optimize the routing policies to improve system performance.

In conclusion, the routing probability is a crucial factor in understanding the behavior of Open Jackson Networks. By defining the network parameters and using the appropriate formula, we can calculate this probability and use it to optimize the routing policies in real-world systems.

### Subsection: 11.2b Analyzing Routing Probability

In the previous subsection, we defined and calculated the routing probability in Open Jackson Networks. In this subsection, we will further analyze the routing probability and its impact on the performance of the network.

The routing probability, denoted by $P_{ij}$, represents the probability that a customer who enters queue $i$ will eventually move to queue $j$. This probability is affected by various factors, such as the arrival rate, service rate, and routing policies. For example, if the arrival rate at queue $i$ is high, the probability of customers moving to other queues may decrease as they are more likely to be served at that queue. Similarly, if the service rate at queue $j$ is low, the probability of customers moving to that queue may decrease as they are more likely to experience longer wait times.

To optimize the routing policies and improve the performance of the network, it is essential to understand the impact of these factors on the routing probability. This can be achieved through sensitivity analysis, where we vary the network parameters and observe the changes in the routing probability. This analysis can help us identify the critical factors that affect the routing probability and make informed decisions to improve the network's performance.

Moreover, the routing probability can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different routing policies. By comparing the routing probabilities under different policies, we can determine which policy results in a higher probability of customers moving to their desired queues. This information can be used to select the most efficient routing policy for the network.

In conclusion, the routing probability is a crucial factor in understanding the flow of customers through Open Jackson Networks. Its analysis and optimization can help improve the performance of these networks and have numerous practical applications in various industries.
