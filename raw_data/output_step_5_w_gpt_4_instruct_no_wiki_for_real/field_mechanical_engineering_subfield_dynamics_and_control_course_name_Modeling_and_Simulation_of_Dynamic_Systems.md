### Section: 1.1 Network Models of Physical System Dynamics

Network models are a fundamental tool in the study of multi-domain dynamic systems. They provide a graphical representation of the system, where each component is represented by a node, and the interactions between components are represented by edges. This section will introduce the concept of network models and their role in understanding and predicting the behavior of dynamic systems.

#### 1.1a Introduction to Network Models

Network models are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing complex systems. They provide a visual representation of the system, making it easier to understand the interactions between different components. In the context of multi-domain modeling, network models can be used to represent systems that span across multiple physical domains.

A network model of a dynamic system is composed of nodes and edges. Each node represents a component of the system, and each edge represents an interaction between components. The nature of these interactions can vary depending on the physical domains involved. For example, in a mechanical system, an edge might represent a physical connection between two components, while in an electrical system, it might represent a wire carrying current.

The power of network models lies in their ability to capture the complex interactions between different components of a system. By representing these interactions graphically, network models allow us to visualize the system's structure and understand how changes in one component can affect the rest of the system.

Network models can be represented mathematically using matrices. The adjacency matrix, for example, is a square matrix that represents the connections between nodes in the network. Each entry in the matrix corresponds to an edge in the network, with a value of 1 indicating the presence of an edge and a value of 0 indicating its absence.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the specifics of network models, including their mathematical representation and their use in simulating dynamic systems. We will also discuss different types of network models, including linear and nonlinear models, and their applications in various fields.

#### 1.1b Types of Network Models

There are several types of network models that can be used to represent dynamic systems. The choice of model depends on the nature of the system and the specific aspects of the system's behavior that we are interested in studying. In this section, we will introduce some of the most common types of network models used in multi-domain modeling.

##### 1.1b.i Graphical Network Models

Graphical network models are perhaps the most intuitive type of network model. They provide a visual representation of the system, with nodes representing components and edges representing interactions. Graphical network models can be used to represent a wide range of systems, from mechanical systems to electrical systems to biological systems.

Graphical network models can be further divided into directed and undirected models. In a directed model, the edges have a direction, indicating the direction of the interaction between components. In an undirected model, the edges do not have a direction, indicating that the interaction is bidirectional.

##### 1.1b.ii Mathematical Network Models

Mathematical network models represent the system using mathematical structures, such as matrices. The most common type of mathematical network model is the adjacency matrix, which we introduced in the previous section. The adjacency matrix is a square matrix that represents the connections between nodes in the network.

Another type of mathematical network model is the Laplacian matrix, which is derived from the adjacency matrix and provides additional information about the system's structure. The Laplacian matrix is particularly useful for studying the stability of the system.

##### 1.1b.iii Dynamic Network Models

Dynamic network models are used to represent systems that change over time. These models incorporate time as a variable, allowing us to study how the system evolves over time. Dynamic network models can be represented graphically, with the nodes and edges changing over time, or mathematically, with the matrices changing over time.

In the following sections, we will explore each of these types of network models in more detail, discussing their strengths and weaknesses, and providing examples of how they can be used to model and simulate dynamic systems.

#### 1.1c Applications of Network Models

Network models are widely used in various fields due to their ability to represent complex systems in a simplified and understandable manner. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of network models in different domains.

##### 1.1c.i Applications in Engineering

In engineering, network models are extensively used to represent and analyze complex systems. For instance, in electrical engineering, circuit diagrams are essentially graphical network models where nodes represent electrical components and edges represent electrical connections. These models are used to analyze the behavior of the circuit under different conditions.

Similarly, in mechanical engineering, network models can represent systems like gear trains or hydraulic systems. Nodes in these models represent mechanical components like gears or pistons, and edges represent mechanical connections like shafts or pipes. These models help in understanding the dynamic behavior of the system under various operating conditions.

##### 1.1c.ii Applications in Computer Science

In computer science, network models are used in the design and analysis of computer networks. Nodes in these models represent devices like computers or routers, and edges represent connections like cables or wireless links. These models are used to study network performance, optimize network design, and troubleshoot network issues.

Network models are also used in the field of machine learning and data mining. For example, graphical models are a type of network model used to represent probabilistic relationships among a set of variables. These models are used in various tasks like pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling.

##### 1.1c.iii Applications in Biology

In biology, network models are used to represent and analyze complex biological systems. For example, in molecular biology, network models are used to represent the interactions between different molecules in a cell. Nodes in these models represent molecules like proteins or genes, and edges represent interactions like binding or regulation. These models are used to study the functioning of the cell and to understand the effects of genetic mutations.

Similarly, in ecology, network models are used to represent the interactions between different species in an ecosystem. These models are used to study the dynamics of the ecosystem and to predict the effects of changes like species extinction or habitat loss.

In conclusion, network models are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing complex systems in various fields. By choosing the appropriate type of network model, we can gain insights into the system's behavior and make predictions about its future behavior.

### Section: 1.2 Bond-graph Notation

#### 1.2a Introduction to Bond-graph Notation

Bond-graph notation is a powerful tool used in the modeling and simulation of dynamic systems. It is a graphical representation of a system, where the components of the system are represented by nodes, and the interactions between these components are represented by edges. This notation is particularly useful in multi-domain modeling, as it allows for the representation of energy flow between different domains in a unified manner.

The bond-graph notation was first introduced by Henry Paynter in the 1960s as a method to model dynamic systems. It has since been widely adopted in various fields, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and control systems.

In bond-graph notation, the nodes represent system components, and are classified into different types based on their energy storage or dissipation characteristics. The main types of nodes are:

1. **0-junctions**: Represent energy conservation. All power flowing into a 0-junction is equal to the power flowing out.

2. **1-junctions**: Represent power continuity. The sum of all power flows into a 1-junction is zero.

3. **C-elements**: Represent capacitive energy storage. The state of a C-element is described by the integral of the power flow into it.

4. **R-elements**: Represent resistive energy dissipation. The power flow into an R-element is proportional to the square of the effort across it.

5. **I-elements**: Represent inertial energy storage. The state of an I-element is described by the integral of the power flow into it.

The edges in a bond-graph represent the power flow between components, and are characterized by two variables: effort and flow. The product of effort and flow at any point in time gives the power at that point.

Bond-graph notation provides a systematic way to derive the equations of motion for a dynamic system. By applying the laws of energy conservation and power continuity at each junction, and the constitutive relations at each element, a set of differential equations can be obtained that describe the behavior of the system.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the bond-graph notation and its application in modeling and simulating dynamic systems. We will also discuss some examples to illustrate the use of bond-graph notation in multi-domain modeling.

#### 1.2b Elements of Bond-graph Notation

In the previous section, we introduced the basic elements of bond-graph notation: 0-junctions, 1-junctions, C-elements, R-elements, and I-elements. In this section, we will delve deeper into these elements and their roles in modeling dynamic systems.

**0-Junctions and 1-Junctions**

0-junctions and 1-junctions are the fundamental building blocks of bond-graph notation. They represent the basic principles of energy conservation and power continuity, respectively.

A **0-junction** connects multiple components in a parallel configuration. It signifies that the total power flowing into the junction is equal to the total power flowing out. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i = 0
$$

where $P_i$ is the power of the $i$-th component connected to the junction.

A **1-junction**, on the other hand, connects components in a series configuration. It signifies that the sum of all power flows into the junction is zero. This can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_i = 0
$$

where $F_i$ is the flow of the $i$-th component connected to the junction.

**C-Elements, R-Elements, and I-Elements**

C-elements, R-elements, and I-elements represent different types of energy storage or dissipation in a system.

A **C-element** represents capacitive energy storage. The state of a C-element is described by the integral of the power flow into it, which can be represented mathematically as:

$$
Q = \int P dt
$$

where $Q$ is the charge stored in the capacitor, $P$ is the power flow, and $t$ is time.

An **R-element** represents resistive energy dissipation. The power flow into an R-element is proportional to the square of the effort across it, which can be represented mathematically as:

$$
P = E^2/R
$$

where $P$ is the power, $E$ is the effort, and $R$ is the resistance.

An **I-element** represents inertial energy storage. The state of an I-element is described by the integral of the power flow into it, which can be represented mathematically as:

$$
I = \int P dt
$$

where $I$ is the inertia, $P$ is the power flow, and $t$ is time.

In the next section, we will discuss how these elements can be combined to create a bond-graph model of a dynamic system.
