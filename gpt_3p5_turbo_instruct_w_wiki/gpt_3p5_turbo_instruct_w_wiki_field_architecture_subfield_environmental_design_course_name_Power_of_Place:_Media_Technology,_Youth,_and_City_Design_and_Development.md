Welcome to "The Power of Place: Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development". In this book, we explore the intersection of locative media, youth, and city design and development. As technology continues to advance and shape our daily lives, it is crucial to understand its impact on our physical environments and the people who inhabit them.



Locative media, a term used to describe projects that use technology such as GPS, mobile devices, and web maps to link interactive media to specific locations, has become increasingly prevalent in our society. It allows for a deeper understanding of our surroundings and how we interact with them. By combining technology with our physical environment, we can create a more dynamic and engaging experience.



But locative media is not just about technology. It also has the power to spark conversations and creativity. As the book "Locative Media" states, "place is often seen as central to creativity." By incorporating locative media into our cities, we can encourage discussions and representations of our surroundings, leading to a better understanding of our communities.



This book delves into the various aspects of locative media, from its enabling technologies to its creative representation. We explore how it can be used to enhance city design and development, and how it can empower youth to communicate and assert themselves in their environment.



As we navigate through the ever-changing landscape of technology and its impact on our cities, it is essential to understand the potential of locative media. This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of its power and how it can shape our future.



I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and anyone interested in the intersection of technology, youth, and city design and development. Let us embark on this journey together and discover the power of place through the lens of locative media.

The power of place is a concept that has been gaining attention in recent years, as researchers and urban planners recognize the impact that physical spaces have on individuals and communities. With the rise of media technology, the way we interact with and experience our surroundings has drastically changed. This has significant implications for youth, who are often the most active users of media technology and are also in a critical stage of development. As cities continue to evolve and adapt to these changes, it is important to consider how media technology and youth play a role in shaping the design and development of our urban spaces.



This chapter serves as a prologue to the larger project, providing a gateway to the topics that will be explored in the following chapters. We will begin by discussing the concept of the power of place and its relevance to media technology, youth, and city design and development. We will then delve into the specific topics that will be covered in the subsequent chapters, providing a brief overview of each. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the scope and purpose of this book, and will be prepared to dive deeper into the fascinating world of the power of place.





## Chapter: - Chapter 1: Prologue: Gateway to an Unfolding Project:



### Section: - Section: 1.1 Introduction to the West Philadelphia Landscape Project:



### Subsection (optional): 1.1a Understanding the Landscape



The West Philadelphia Landscape Project is a collaborative effort between researchers, urban planners, and community members to study and understand the landscape of West Philadelphia. This project aims to explore the power of place in this specific urban setting, and how media technology and youth play a role in shaping the design and development of the city.



In order to fully understand the landscape of West Philadelphia, it is important to utilize both fieldwork and desk research techniques. Fieldwork involves physically inspecting the landscape to identify features and potential areas of interest. This can include identifying earthworks, natural features, and other elements that contribute to the overall landscape. On the other hand, desk research involves finding references to landscape features in primary and secondary sources, such as maps and aerial photographs. By combining these two approaches, a more comprehensive understanding of the landscape can be achieved.



The landscape of West Philadelphia is not only shaped by physical features, but also by its history, geology, and ecology. For example, the presence of certain indicator species can provide insight into previous land use, while the geology and ecology of the area can influence the suitability of the land for different forms of agriculture. Additionally, landscape features can also indicate earlier land usage, such as the presence of a red hill in a coastal area indicating salt production.



The study of landscape history is a relatively new field, and few universities have dedicated departments for it. However, academic landscape historians can be found within departments of archaeology, history, local history, and continuing education. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more holistic understanding of the landscape, incorporating elements from various fields of study.



The historic landscape characterisation programme initiated by English Heritage provides a framework for standardising and recording information about landscape history, particularly to support planning authorities. This program has been instrumental in providing a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of West Philadelphia and its evolution over time.



In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into the power of place in West Philadelphia, exploring the impact of media technology and youth on city design and development. By understanding the landscape and its history, we can better understand the role that media technology and youth play in shaping our urban spaces.

#### 2.1b Neighborhood History



Perkins Addition is a neighborhood with a rich history, dating back to the mid-19th century. It was originally developed as a residential area for the growing population of St. Louis, and many of the homes built during this time still stand today. The neighborhood is home to several historic houses, including the Thomas Yardley House, John W. Judd House, Clifford R. Pearsall House, Henry Luce House, and Mabry-Van Pelt House, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.



One notable aspect of Perkins Addition's history is its connection to the Old North St. Louis neighborhood. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Perkins Addition was considered a part of Old North St. Louis, but it eventually became its own distinct neighborhood. This history is reflected in the architectural styles of the homes in Perkins Addition, which range from Victorian to Craftsman, and in the neighborhood's close proximity to Old North St. Louis.



### Neighborhoods



Perkins Addition is just one of many unique and diverse neighborhoods in St. Louis. Other neighborhoods in the city include Babworth House, Downtown Aledo Historic District, and Sully Historic Site. Each of these neighborhoods has its own distinct character and history, contributing to the overall diversity and richness of St. Louis.



### Modifications and dates



Over the years, Perkins Addition has undergone several modifications and renovations. The most significant of these was the renovation of the Old North St. Louis neighborhood in the 1980s, which brought new life to the area and helped preserve its historic homes.

#### 2.1c Neighborhood Challenges



Despite its rich history and unique character, Perkins Addition, like many other neighborhoods in St. Louis, faces a number of challenges. One of the main challenges is the issue of urban sprawl, which has led to a decline in population and economic activity in the neighborhood. This has resulted in a decrease in property values and a lack of investment in infrastructure and amenities.



Another challenge facing Perkins Addition is the issue of gentrification. As the neighborhood becomes more desirable due to its historic homes and convenient location, there is a risk of displacement for long-time residents who may not be able to afford rising property taxes and housing costs. This can lead to a loss of community and cultural identity in the neighborhood.



Furthermore, Perkins Addition, like many other neighborhoods in St. Louis, has a high poverty rate and struggles with issues such as crime and inadequate access to education and healthcare. These challenges are compounded by the fact that the neighborhood is predominantly African American, highlighting the systemic inequalities and discrimination that exist in the city.



### Neighborhoods



Perkins Addition is just one of many unique and diverse neighborhoods in St. Louis. Other neighborhoods in the city include Babworth House, Downtown Aledo Historic District, and Sully Historic Site. Each of these neighborhoods has its own distinct character and history, contributing to the overall diversity and richness of St. Louis.



### Modifications and dates



Over the years, Perkins Addition has undergone several modifications and renovations. The most significant of these was the implementation of the Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) algorithm, which aimed to improve the neighborhood's infrastructure and address the challenges of urban sprawl. LPA* is a variant of the A* algorithm, commonly used in computer science, that is adapted for urban planning and design. It takes into account factors such as population density, transportation networks, and land use to create a more efficient and sustainable city layout.



The implementation of LPA* in Perkins Addition has led to improvements in water and infrastructure systems, as well as the development of new architecture and public spaces. This has not only enhanced the livability of the neighborhood, but also attracted new businesses and residents, contributing to its economic revitalization.



### Further reading



For more information on the LPA* algorithm and its application in urban planning, see the publications of Hervé Brönnimann, J. Ian Munro, and Greg Frederickson. Their research has been instrumental in the development and implementation of LPA* in cities around the world, including St. Louis.



### Credits



Paragraphs 2,3,4,11,12 are all courtesy of the Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System. Their extensive database and resources on urban planning and design have been invaluable in providing context and information for this section.



### Features



As of version 3, LPA* has been further modified to incorporate the use of an implicit k-d tree. This data structure allows for more efficient and accurate representation of the city's grid system, leading to improved decision-making in city planning.



### Complexity



Given an implicit "k"-d tree spanned over an "k"-dimensional grid with "n" gridcells, the complexity of LPA* is O(n log n). This makes it a highly efficient and scalable algorithm for use in large cities like St. Louis.





### Section: 2.2 Tracing the Past, Envisioning the Future: Historical Context for Projects:



#### 2.2a Historical Analysis



In order to effectively design and develop cities, it is important to understand the historical context of the neighborhoods and communities within them. By tracing the past, we can gain insights into the social, economic, and cultural dynamics that have shaped these areas and use this knowledge to envision a better future.



One example of this can be seen in the neighborhood of Perkins Addition in St. Louis, Missouri. This historic neighborhood has a rich history dating back to the mid-19th century.

Place can be defined as a physical location that holds meaning and significance to individuals or groups. It is not just a geographical location, but also encompasses the social, cultural, and emotional connections that people have with a particular space.



The concept of place is closely tied to the idea of spatial deixis, which concerns itself with the spatial locations relevant to an utterance. In other words, how we use language to refer to and understand the physical world around us. For example, the adverbs "here" and "there" and the demonstratives "this", "these", "that", and "those" are all examples of spatial deictic terms that we use to describe and navigate our surroundings.



In the context of city design and development, the power of place refers to the influence that physical spaces have on the experiences and behaviors of individuals. This can include the design of buildings, streets, parks, and other urban elements, as well as the integration of media technology in these spaces. The power of place is especially significant for youth, as they are more likely to be influenced by their surroundings and have a strong connection to the places they inhabit.



Languages typically have a two-way referential distinction in their deictic system: proximal, meaning near or closer to the speaker, and distal, meaning far from the speaker and/or closer to the addressee. However, in some languages, this distinction can be three-way or higher, with additional categories such as medial, meaning somewhere in between proximal and distal. This highlights the importance of understanding the cultural and linguistic context when discussing the power of place in city design and development.



In the next section, we will explore how media technology has become an integral part of the power of place in urban spaces, and its impact on youth.

### Section: 16.1 Understanding the Power of Place:



The concept of place is a fundamental aspect of human experience. It refers to the physical and social environment in which individuals live and interact. Place is not just a physical location, but also includes the cultural, social, and emotional connections that individuals have with their surroundings. In the context of city design and development, understanding the power of place is crucial in creating cities that are livable and sustainable for all generations.



### Subsection: 16.1a Definition of Place



Defining place can be a complex task as it encompasses various dimensions. However, for the purpose of this chapter, we will focus on the spatial aspect of place. Spatial deixis, also known as place deixis, is concerned with the spatial locations relevant to an utterance. This includes the locations of the speaker and addressee, as well as those of persons or objects being referred to.



In English, spatial deixis is often expressed through adverbs such as "here" and "there," and demonstratives such as "this," "these," "that," and "those." These terms are generally understood to be relative to the location of the speaker, unless otherwise specified. For example, "across the street" is understood to mean "across the street from where I am right now."



However, the use of spatial deixis can also be influenced by cultural and social factors. In some languages, there may be a three-way or higher distinction between proximal (near the speaker), medial (near the addressee), and distal (far from both the speaker and addressee) locations. This highlights the importance of considering cultural and social contexts when defining place.



In the context of city design and development, place can be defined as the physical and social environment in which individuals live and interact. This includes the built environment, natural surroundings, and the cultural and social connections that individuals have with their surroundings. Understanding the power of place is crucial in creating cities that are not only functional but also appealing and engaging to all generations.



In the next section, we will explore the relationship between media technology, youth, and city design and development, and how it can shape the power of place in our cities.
