## Chapter: - Chapter 3: Shape Grammars 2D:



### Section: - Section: 3.1 Introduction to Shape Grammars for 2D Site Plan:



In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of shape grammars and their application in 2D design. In this section, we will provide a brief overview of shape grammars and their components to refresh our understanding before delving deeper into their application in housing design.



Shape grammars are a specific class of production systems that generate geometric shapes. They were first introduced in a seminal article by George Stiny and James Gips in 1971 and have since been widely used in architectural design. The mathematical and algorithmic foundations of shape grammars were developed by George Stiny in his book "Pictorial and Formal Aspects of Shapes and Shape Grammars" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975). 



A shape grammar consists of "shape rules" and a "generation engine" that selects and processes rules. The shape rules define how an existing shape can be transformed and consist of two parts separated by an arrow pointing from left to right. The part left of the arrow is termed the "Left-Hand Side" (LHS) and depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker. The part right of the arrow is termed the "Right-Hand Side" (RHS) and depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. The marker helps to locate and orient the new shape.



A shape grammar minimally consists of three shape rules: a "start rule", at least one transformation rule, and a "termination rule". The start rule is necessary to begin the shape generation process, while the termination rule is necessary to stop the process. The simplest way to stop the process is by a shape rule that removes the marker. 



Shape grammars differ from Chomsky grammars in a major respect: the production rules in shape grammars are not limited to generating strings of symbols, but instead, they generate geometric shapes. This makes shape grammars a powerful tool for generating and evaluating design solutions in architecture.



In the next subsection, we will explore the basics of shape grammars in more detail, including their types and applications in housing design.

### Subsection: 3.1b Application of Shape Grammars in 2D



Shape grammars have been widely used in architectural design for their ability to generate complex and varied designs. In 2D site planning, shape grammars can be applied to generate different layouts and configurations for housing developments. This allows for a more efficient and systematic approach to designing housing projects.



One of the key advantages of using shape grammars in 2D site planning is the ability to incorporate design constraints and rules into the generation process. This ensures that the generated designs adhere to specific requirements and guidelines, such as building codes and zoning regulations. This can save time and effort in the design process, as the generated designs are already compliant with necessary regulations.



Another advantage of using shape grammars in 2D site planning is the ability to generate multiple design options quickly. By simply changing the shape rules or parameters, a variety of design options can be generated, allowing for a more thorough exploration of design possibilities. This can lead to more innovative and efficient housing designs.



Furthermore, shape grammars can also be used to generate designs that are tailored to specific site conditions.

This can result in more sustainable and context-sensitive housing designs.



In conclusion, shape grammars have a wide range of applications in 2D site planning for housing developments. Their ability to generate complex and varied designs, incorporate design constraints, and optimize for site-specific conditions make them a valuable tool for computational design in housing.

### Subsection: 3.1c Examples of 2D Shape Grammars



To better understand the application of shape grammars in housing design, let us look at some examples of 2D shape grammars. These examples will demonstrate how shape rules can be used to generate different housing designs based on a set of predefined rules.



#### Example 1: Basic House Design



The first example is a simple 2D shape grammar for generating a basic house design. The start rule for this grammar would be a rectangle representing the base of the house. The transformation rule would then add a triangle on top of the rectangle to create a roof. The termination rule would remove the marker, completing the house design.



#### Example 2: Multi-Story Apartment Building



The second example is a more complex 2D shape grammar for generating a multi-story apartment building. The start rule would be a rectangle representing the base of the building. The transformation rule would then add additional rectangles on top of the base to create multiple floors. The termination rule would remove the marker, completing the building design.



#### Example 3: Modular Housing Units



The third example is a 2D shape grammar for generating modular housing units. The start rule would be a rectangle representing the base of the unit. The transformation rule would then add additional rectangles on either side of the base to create additional rooms. The termination rule would remove the marker, completing the modular unit design.



These examples demonstrate the versatility and flexibility of shape grammars in generating different housing designs. By defining a set of rules and a generation engine, architects and designers can use shape grammars to quickly and efficiently generate a variety of housing designs. In the next section, we will explore the use of shape grammars in 3D design and their application in housing design.





## Chapter: - Chapter 3: Shape Grammars 2D:



### Section: - Section: 3.2 Applying Shape Grammars to Housing Design:



### Subsection (optional): 3.2a Understanding Housing Design



In this section, we will explore how shape grammars can be applied to housing design. Before we dive into the specifics, let's first review the basics of shape grammars.



Shape grammars are a type of production system that generates geometric shapes. They were first introduced by George Stiny and James Gips in 1971 and have since been widely used in architectural design. The mathematical and algorithmic foundations of shape grammars were further developed by George Stiny in his book "Pictorial and Formal Aspects of Shapes and Shape Grammars" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975).



A shape grammar consists of "shape rules" and a "generation engine" that selects and processes these rules. The shape rules define how an existing shape can be transformed and consist of two parts: the Left-Hand Side (LHS) and the Right-Hand Side (RHS). The LHS depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker, while the RHS depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. This marker helps to locate and orient the new shape.



A shape grammar typically includes three types of rules: a "start rule", at least one transformation rule, and a "termination rule". The start rule is necessary to begin the shape generation process, while the termination rule is necessary to stop the process. The simplest way to stop the process is by a shape rule that removes the marker.



One of the key differences between shape grammars and Chomsky grammars is that shape grammars can generate geometric shapes, rather than just strings of symbols. This makes shape grammars a powerful tool for generating complex and varied designs.



Now that we have reviewed the basics of shape grammars, let's explore how they can be applied to housing design. Housing design is a complex process that involves considering various factors such as functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability. Shape grammars can assist in this process by providing a systematic approach to generating and evaluating design options.



Shape grammars can be used to generate different housing designs by defining shape rules that represent different design elements, such as building materials, room layouts, and facade styles. These rules can then be combined and iteratively applied to generate a variety of design options. This allows for a more efficient and structured approach to exploring design possibilities.



Furthermore, shape grammars can also be used to evaluate the feasibility and functionality of a design. By defining specific rules for functional elements such as room sizes and circulation paths, shape grammars can help ensure that the generated designs meet the necessary requirements for a functional and livable housing design.



In conclusion, shape grammars offer a powerful tool for housing design by providing a systematic approach to generating and evaluating design options. By understanding the basics of shape grammars and their components, designers can utilize this method to create innovative and functional housing designs.

Housing design is a complex process that involves considering various factors such as functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability. Shape grammars can be a powerful tool in this process as they allow for the generation of complex and varied designs. By defining shape rules and a generation engine, designers can create a set of rules that guide the generation of housing designs.



One of the key advantages of using shape grammars in housing design is the ability to incorporate implicit data structures. These data structures allow for the representation of complex relationships between different design elements. For example, a shape rule can be defined to generate a specific type of window based on the size and location of the room it is placed in. This allows for a more efficient and systematic approach to housing design.



Furthermore, shape grammars can also be used to incorporate sustainability principles into housing design. By defining rules that prioritize energy efficiency and use of sustainable materials, designers can create housing designs that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also environmentally friendly.



Another important aspect of housing design is the consideration of cultural and social factors. Shape grammars can be used to incorporate these factors into the design process by defining rules that reflect the cultural and social values of the community for which the housing is being designed. This can lead to more culturally sensitive and inclusive designs.



In conclusion, shape grammars offer a comprehensive approach to housing design by allowing for the incorporation of implicit data structures, sustainability principles, and cultural and social factors. By utilizing shape grammars, designers can create housing designs that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing but also considerate of various important factors. 





## Chapter: - Chapter 3: Shape Grammars 2D:



### Section: - Section: 3.2 Applying Shape Grammars to Housing Design:



### Subsection (optional): 3.2c Case Studies in Housing Design



In the previous section, we discussed the application of shape grammars in housing design and how they can be used to incorporate various factors such as functionality, aesthetics, sustainability, and cultural and social values. In this section, we will explore some case studies where shape grammars have been successfully applied in housing design.



One notable case study is the work of Pettersen (1994), where uncertainties in group 2 (workmanship and quality of elements) and group 3 (behaviour) were considered in the design process. This study showed the importance of considering occupants' behavior in the calculation of energy demand in buildings. Pettersen found that the total energy use follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of around 7.6% when uncertainties due to occupants are considered, and around 4.0% when uncertainties due to building elements are considered.



Another significant case study is the Stamford Brook project by Leeds Metropolitan, where 700 dwellings were built to high efficiency standards. The results of this project showed a significant gap between the expected energy use before construction and the actual energy use once the houses were occupied. The workmanship was analyzed in this study, and the authors emphasized the importance of thermal bridges and internal partitions in the final energy use. The monitored dwellings showed a large difference between the real energy use and the estimated energy use using the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP), with one of the houses using 176% more energy than expected.



Hopfe (2008) also published several papers on uncertainties in building design, including workmanship. In a more recent publication, Hopfe (2008) looked into uncertainties in group 2 and 3, defining them as normal distributions. The random parameters were sampled to generate 200 tests, which were then sent to a simulator (VA114) for analysis. This study found that the uncertainty in the value used for infiltration had the largest influence on cooling and heating demand.



These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of shape grammars in housing design, particularly in incorporating uncertainties and sustainability principles. They also highlight the importance of considering cultural and social factors in the design process. By using shape grammars, designers can create housing designs that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional, sustainable, and culturally sensitive.

#### Subsection: 4.2a Introduction to 3D Grammar Practice



Before diving into the practice of 3D shape grammars, it is important to understand the basics of this design tool. As mentioned earlier, shape grammars are a formalism for generating designs based on a set of rules and constraints. These rules and constraints are typically represented in the form of a grammar, which consists of a set of symbols, production rules, and constraints.



To practice 3D shape grammars by hand, we will need to understand the different components of a grammar and how they work together to generate designs. Let's take a closer look at each of these components.



##### Symbols



Symbols are the basic building blocks of a shape grammar. They represent the different elements or components that can be used to create a design. For example, in the context of housing design, symbols could represent walls, windows, doors, and other architectural elements.



##### Production Rules



Production rules define how symbols can be combined and transformed to create a design. These rules specify which symbols can be replaced by other symbols or groups of symbols, and in what order. For example, a production rule could state that a wall symbol can be replaced by a window symbol and a door symbol, creating a wall with a window and a door.

## Chapter 5: 3D Abstract Models of Clusters:



### Section: 5.2 Understanding the Role of Shape Grammars in the 3D Study of Clusters:



### Subsection: 5.2a Role of Shape Grammars in 3D Study



In the previous section, we discussed the use of 3D abstract models in the design and development process of housing clusters. These models provide a realistic representation of the built environment and allow for a better understanding of spatial relationships and interactions within the cluster. However, the creation of these models can be a complex and time-consuming process. This is where shape grammars come into play.



Shape grammars are a specific class of production systems that generate geometric shapes. They were first introduced by George Stiny and James Gips in 1971 and have since been used in various fields, including architecture and urban design. In the context of 3D abstract models of clusters, shape grammars provide a systematic and efficient way to generate and manipulate geometric shapes.



The mathematical and algorithmic foundations of shape grammars were developed by George Stiny in his book "Pictorial and Formal Aspects of Shapes and Shape Grammars" (Birkhäuser Basel, 1975). This book also contains two independent constructions showing that shape grammars can simulate Turing machines. This demonstrates the computational power and versatility of shape grammars in generating complex shapes.



So how do shape grammars work? A shape grammar consists of "shape rules" and a "generation engine" that selects and processes these rules. The shape rules define how an existing shape can be transformed, and they consist of two parts: the Left-Hand Side (LHS) and the Right-Hand Side (RHS). The LHS depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker, while the RHS depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned.



A shape grammar typically consists of three types of rules: a start rule, at least one transformation rule, and a termination rule. The start rule is necessary to initiate the shape generation process, while the termination rule is used to stop the process. This can be achieved by removing the marker. Unlike Chomsky grammars, shape grammars allow for rules to be applied in parallel, making them more flexible and powerful in generating complex shapes.



The use of shape grammars in the 3D study of clusters allows for a more systematic and efficient approach to creating 3D abstract models. By defining a set of rules and conditions, designers can generate a variety of shapes and manipulate them to create different configurations of the housing cluster. This not only saves time and effort but also allows for a more exploratory and iterative design process.



In conclusion, shape grammars play a crucial role in the 3D study of clusters by providing a systematic and efficient way to generate and manipulate geometric shapes. They allow for a more intuitive and interactive approach to creating 3D abstract models, making them an essential tool in the design and development process of housing clusters.

This allows for a more efficient and streamlined process in creating 3D abstract models of clusters. Additionally, shape grammars provide a level of consistency and standardization in the design process, ensuring that all shapes adhere to a set of rules and guidelines.



To apply shape grammars in the 3D study of clusters, we must first define the shape rules and the generation engine. The shape rules consist of two parts: the Left-Hand Side (LHS) and the Right-Hand Side (RHS). The LHS depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker, while the RHS depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. These rules are then processed by the generation engine, which selects and applies the appropriate rules to generate new shapes.



In addition to the start rule, transformation rule, and termination rule mentioned in the previous section, shape grammars can also include other types of rules, such as context-sensitive rules and stochastic rules. Context-sensitive rules take into account the surrounding shapes and their relationships, while stochastic rules introduce an element of randomness in the generation process.



The use of shape grammars in the 3D study of clusters has been further enhanced by advancements in technology. With the availability of powerful computational tools, designers can now create and manipulate complex shapes and patterns with ease.

### Section: 6.2 Understanding Given Spatial Relations



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of AutoGrammar and its history. Now, we will dive deeper into the understanding of spatial relations, which is a crucial aspect of computational design for housing.



#### 6.2a Understanding Spatial Relations



Spatial relations refer to the relationships between objects in a given space. In the context of computational design, understanding spatial relations is essential for generating designs that are functional and aesthetically pleasing.



To assist in understanding spatial relations, researchers have developed various spatial calculi, such as Allen's interval algebra and Vilain's & Kautz's point algebra. These calculi provide a framework for representing and reasoning about spatial relations.



One of the earliest and most fundamental spatial relations is the connection relation. This relation is the first spatial relation that human babies acquire, followed by understanding orientation relations and distance relations. This result has been observed in cognitive psychology and can be explained within the theory of cognitive prism.



The theory of cognitive prism states that the connection relation is primitive, while an orientation relation is a distance comparison relation. For example, if you are standing in front of me, it can be interpreted as you are nearer to my front side than my other sides. Similarly, a distance relation can be seen as a connection relation using a third object. For instance, if you are one meter away from me, it can be interpreted as a one meter long object connected with you and me simultaneously.



#### 6.2b Influence from Cognitive Psychology



The understanding of spatial relations in computational design has been heavily influenced by cognitive psychology. The theory of cognitive prism provides a framework for explaining the internal relations among different spatial relations.



Moreover, cognitive psychology has also contributed to the development of spatial-temporal reasoning, which is an area of artificial intelligence that draws from computer science and cognitive science. The goal of spatial-temporal reasoning is to represent and reason about spatial-temporal knowledge in the mind.



#### 6.2c Fragmentary Representations of Temporal Calculi



While cognitive psychology has provided valuable insights into spatial relations, AI researchers have also contributed to the development of fragmentary representations of temporal calculi. These include Allen's interval algebra and Vilain's & Kautz's point algebra, which are examples of temporal calculi.



In addition, there are various spatial calculi, such as mereotopological calculi, Frank's cardinal direction calculus, and Freksa's double cross calculus. These calculi provide a formal framework for representing and reasoning about spatial relations.



Recently, there has been a growing interest in spatio-temporal calculi, which combine both spatial and temporal aspects. These calculi are essential for understanding and representing the complex relationships between objects in space and time.



In the next section, we will explore how these spatial and temporal calculi can be applied in AutoGrammar to generate unique and innovative designs for housing.

#### 6.2b Applying Spatial Relations in Design



The understanding of spatial relations in computational design has been heavily influenced by cognitive psychology. The theory of cognitive prism provides a framework for explaining the internal relationships between objects in a given space. This understanding has been applied in various design processes, such as architectural design, urban planning, and product design.



In architectural design, understanding spatial relations is crucial for creating functional and aesthetically pleasing spaces. Architects use spatial calculi to represent and reason about the relationships between different elements in a building, such as walls, doors, and windows. This allows them to create designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional and efficient.



Similarly, in urban planning, understanding spatial relations is essential for creating livable and sustainable cities. By using spatial calculi, urban planners can analyze the relationships between different elements in a city, such as buildings, roads, and parks. This helps them to design cities that are well-connected and promote efficient movement and interaction between people and their environment.



In product design, understanding spatial relations is crucial for creating user-friendly and ergonomic designs. By considering the spatial relationships between different components of a product, designers can create products that are easy to use and comfortable for the user.



#### 6.2c Temporal References in Spatial Relations



In addition to size, distance, volume, and order, temporal references also play a role in spatial relations. This is because our understanding of space is closely linked to our perception of time. For example, when we say that something is "in front" of us, we are also implying that it is closer to us in time. This understanding of temporal references in spatial relations has been studied in cognitive psychology and has been applied in various design processes.



In architectural design, temporal references are considered when designing spaces that are meant to be experienced over time, such as museums or performance venues. In urban planning, temporal references are taken into account when designing spaces that are meant to be used at different times of the day, such as parks or public transportation systems. In product design, temporal references are considered when designing products that are meant to be used over a period of time, such as furniture or appliances.



## Conclusion



In this section, we have discussed the importance of understanding spatial relations in computational design for housing. We have explored the various spatial calculi that have been developed to assist in representing and reasoning about spatial relations. We have also seen how this understanding has been applied in different design processes, such as architectural design, urban planning, and product design. Additionally, we have discussed the role of temporal references in spatial relations and how they are considered in design processes. In the next section, we will explore the use of spatial relations in AutoGrammar and how it can assist in generating housing designs.

#### 6.2b Applying Spatial Relations in Design



The understanding of spatial relations in computational design has been heavily influenced by cognitive psychology. The theory of cognitive prism provides a framework for explaining the internal relations among spatial relations and how they can be applied in design.



One example of applying spatial relations in design is through the use of object-based spatial databases. These databases, such as GRASS GIS, support both raster and vector representations and allow for spatial-temporal reasoning. This means that designers can use these databases to analyze and manipulate spatial data over time, allowing for more dynamic and responsive designs.



Another way spatial relations are applied in design is through the use of fragmentary representations of temporal calculi. These calculi, such as Allen's interval algebra and Vilain's & Kautz's point algebra, provide a way to represent and reason about temporal relationships between objects. By incorporating these temporal calculi into computational design, designers can create designs that not only consider spatial relationships but also take into account how those relationships may change over time.



#### 6.2c Case Studies in Spatial Relations



To further illustrate the application of spatial relations in design, let's look at some case studies. One example is the use of mereotopological calculi in designing urban spaces. Mereotopological calculi, which describe the relationships between parts and wholes, can be used to analyze and plan the layout of a city. By understanding the spatial relationships between different parts of a city, designers can create more efficient and functional urban spaces.



Another case study is the use of Frank's cardinal direction calculus in designing interior spaces. This calculus, which describes the relationships between cardinal directions, can be used to create more intuitive and user-friendly layouts for interior spaces. By understanding how people perceive and navigate through space, designers can use cardinal direction calculus to create designs that are more intuitive and easy to navigate.



In conclusion, understanding spatial relations is crucial in computational design for housing. By incorporating spatial calculi and databases into the design process, designers can create more functional and aesthetically pleasing designs that take into account both spatial and temporal relationships. Case studies further demonstrate the practical application of these concepts in real-world design projects.
