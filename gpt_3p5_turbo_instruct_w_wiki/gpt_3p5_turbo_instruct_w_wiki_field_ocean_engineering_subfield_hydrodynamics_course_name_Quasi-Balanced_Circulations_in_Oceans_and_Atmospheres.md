# Quasi-Balanced Circulations in Oceans and Atmospheres: A Comprehensive Guide":





## Foreward



Welcome to "Quasi-Balanced Circulations in Oceans and Atmospheres: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a thorough understanding of the complex and interconnected circulations that occur in our oceans and atmosphere. As our planet's climate continues to change, it is crucial that we have a deep understanding of these circulations in order to accurately predict and mitigate the impacts of these changes.



One of the key circulations that will be explored in this book is the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). This circulation plays a crucial role in the global climate system, as it transports heat and nutrients throughout the Atlantic Ocean. The context provided above highlights the important role of convection and entrainment in the Labrador Sea in the formation of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), a key component of the AMOC.



Through detailed analysis and discussion, this book will delve into the various factors that influence the production of LSW and its impact on the AMOC. We will also explore the interplay between LSW production and the strength of the Subpolar Gyre (SPG), as well as its potential anti-correlation with Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW).



While there is still ongoing debate and research surrounding the connection between Labrador Sea variability and AMOC variability, this book will provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding and potential future developments in this area.



We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the complex circulations in our oceans and atmosphere. We would like to thank the contributors and reviewers who have helped make this book possible, and we hope that it will contribute to further advancements in this field of study.



Happy reading!



Sincerely,



The Authors





## Chapter: Quasi-Balanced Circulations in Oceans and Atmospheres: A Comprehensive Guide



### Introduction



The study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres is a complex and fascinating field that has been the subject of extensive research and study. These circulations play a crucial role in shaping the Earth's climate and weather patterns, and understanding them is essential for predicting and mitigating the impacts of natural disasters such as hurricanes, typhoons, and droughts. In this chapter, we will provide a comprehensive guide to quasi-balanced circulations, covering their definition, characteristics, and key processes involved. We will also discuss the various methods and techniques used to study these circulations, as well as their applications in different fields such as meteorology, oceanography, and climate science.



The term "quasi-balanced" refers to a state of equilibrium that is not perfectly balanced but is close enough to be considered as such. In the context of oceans and atmospheres, quasi-balanced circulations refer to large-scale motions that are driven by a combination of forces, including gravity, rotation, and pressure gradients. These circulations are characterized by a delicate balance between these forces, which results in the formation of distinct patterns and structures. Understanding this balance is crucial for predicting the behavior of these circulations and their impact on the Earth's climate.



In this chapter, we will explore the various types of quasi-balanced circulations, including atmospheric circulations such as the Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells, and oceanic circulations such as the Gulf Stream and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We will also discuss the role of these circulations in redistributing heat and moisture around the globe, as well as their influence on the formation of weather systems and ocean currents. Additionally, we will delve into the key processes that drive these circulations, such as convection, advection, and Ekman transport, and how they interact with each other to maintain the quasi-balanced state.



Finally, we will discuss the various methods and techniques used to study quasi-balanced circulations, including observational data, numerical models, and theoretical approaches. We will also highlight the challenges and limitations of each method and how they can be overcome to improve our understanding of these circulations. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of quasi-balanced circulations and will be ready to dive deeper into the more advanced topics covered in the subsequent chapters.

### Section: 1.1 Fundamental balance and conservation principles for quasi-balanced flow



In order to understand quasi-balanced circulations, it is important to first establish the fundamental balance and conservation principles that govern them. These principles are based on the laws of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, and they provide a framework for understanding the behavior of these circulations.



#### Subsection: 1.1a Definition of Quasi-Balanced Flow



Quasi-balanced flow can be defined as a state of motion in which the forces acting on a fluid parcel are in approximate balance. This means that the acceleration of the parcel is small compared to the forces acting on it, and the parcel can be considered to be in a state of quasi-equilibrium. In other words, the parcel is not accelerating significantly, and its motion is primarily determined by the balance between the various forces acting on it.



The forces that contribute to the balance in quasi-balanced flow include gravity, rotation, and pressure gradients. These forces are responsible for driving large-scale motions in the oceans and atmosphere, and their balance is crucial for maintaining the stability and structure of these circulations.



In the absence of thermal conduction and viscous forces, the equation for entropy production in quasi-balanced flow collapses to zero, indicating that the flow is isentropic. This means that the specific entropy of the fluid parcel remains constant as it moves within the circulation. However, in the presence of thermal conduction and viscous forces, the equation for entropy production becomes non-zero, and the flow is no longer isentropic.



Understanding the definition of quasi-balanced flow is essential for studying and analyzing the behavior of these circulations. In the following sections, we will explore the various types of quasi-balanced circulations and the processes that drive them, providing a comprehensive guide to this fascinating field of study.





### Section: 1.1 Fundamental balance and conservation principles for quasi-balanced flow:



#### Subsection: 1.1b Conservation Principles



Conservation principles play a crucial role in understanding and studying quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. These principles are based on the fundamental idea that the Earth's natural resources must be protected and managed in a sustainable manner for the benefit of present and future generations. In this subsection, we will discuss the key conservation principles that are relevant to the study of quasi-balanced circulations.



One of the most important conservation principles is the principle of sustainability, which states that the Earth's resources must be used in a way that does not deplete or harm them for future generations. This principle is particularly relevant to the study of quasi-balanced circulations, as these circulations are driven by natural forces that must be carefully managed to maintain their delicate balance. For example, the Gulf Stream, a major oceanic circulation, is driven by the Earth's rotation and the difference in temperature between the equator and the poles. If these forces were to be disrupted or depleted, the Gulf Stream could be significantly altered, leading to drastic changes in global climate patterns.



Another important conservation principle is the principle of intergenerational equity, which emphasizes the responsibility of current generations to protect and preserve the Earth's resources for future generations. This principle is particularly relevant to the study of quasi-balanced circulations, as these circulations have a significant impact on the Earth's climate and weather patterns, which can have long-term effects on future generations. For example, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, a major oceanic circulation, plays a crucial role in regulating global climate by redistributing heat and moisture around the globe. If this circulation were to be disrupted or altered, it could have severe consequences for future generations.



The principle of precaution is also relevant to the study of quasi-balanced circulations, as it emphasizes the need to take precautionary measures to prevent potential harm to the environment. This principle is particularly important in the context of climate change, as the Earth's natural systems are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and other factors. By understanding and studying quasi-balanced circulations, we can better predict and mitigate the potential impacts of climate change on these circulations and the Earth's climate as a whole.



In conclusion, conservation principles are essential for understanding and studying quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. These principles provide a framework for managing and protecting the Earth's natural resources, which are crucial for maintaining the delicate balance of these circulations.

#### Subsection: 1.1c Applications in Oceanography and Meteorology



The study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres has numerous applications in the fields of oceanography and meteorology. These applications range from improving our understanding of global climate change to enhancing weather and climate predictions.



One of the key applications of studying quasi-balanced circulations is in the field of ocean variability. The missions of TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 have revealed the surprising variability of the ocean, showing how much it changes from season to season, year to year, and even on longer time scales. This has led to a better understanding of the role of the ocean in climate change and has improved weather and climate predictions. The data from these missions are used to improve ocean models, forecast hurricane intensity, and identify and track large ocean/atmosphere phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña.



Another important application of studying quasi-balanced circulations is in the management of natural resources. The principle of sustainability, which states that the Earth's resources must be used in a way that does not deplete or harm them for future generations, is particularly relevant in this context. Quasi-balanced circulations, such as the Gulf Stream and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, play a crucial role in regulating global climate and weather patterns. By understanding and managing these circulations, we can ensure that they continue to function in a sustainable manner for future generations.



In addition, the study of quasi-balanced circulations has practical applications in various industries. For example, the data from TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 are used in routing ships, improving the safety and efficiency of offshore industry operations, managing fisheries, and tracking marine mammals. These missions have also made major contributions to the understanding of ocean variability, which is crucial for industries that rely on the ocean for their operations.



Overall, the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres has numerous applications in oceanography and meteorology. By understanding and managing these circulations, we can improve our understanding of global climate change, enhance weather and climate predictions, and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources for future generations. 





### Section: 1.2 Equations of motion:



The study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres is based on the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics. These principles, which were first described by Sir Isaac Newton in the 18th century, form the basis of our understanding of the behavior of fluids in motion. In this section, we will discuss the equations of motion that govern the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



#### Subsection: 1.2a Newton's Laws in Fluid Dynamics



Newton's laws of motion, which were originally developed for solid bodies, can also be applied to fluids. In fluid dynamics, these laws are used to describe the motion of a fluid particle in a flow field. The first law, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will continue to move in a straight line at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This law can be applied to fluids by considering a fluid particle at rest in a flow field. If there are no external forces acting on the particle, it will remain at rest.



The second law, also known as the law of acceleration, states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. In fluid dynamics, this law can be applied to a fluid particle in a flow field by considering the forces acting on the particle, such as pressure and gravity. The acceleration of the particle will depend on the net force acting on it and the mass of the particle.



The third law, also known as the law of action and reaction, states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In fluid dynamics, this law can be applied to the forces acting on a fluid particle. For example, if a fluid particle exerts a force on a solid object, the object will exert an equal and opposite force on the particle.



In addition to Newton's laws, the equations of motion for fluids also include the conservation of mass and the conservation of momentum. The conservation of mass states that the mass of a fluid is conserved in a closed system, meaning that the total mass of the fluid remains constant over time. The conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a fluid is conserved in a closed system, meaning that the total momentum of the fluid remains constant over time.



These equations of motion, along with other principles of fluid mechanics, form the basis of our understanding of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. In the following sections, we will explore how these equations are applied to different types of quasi-balanced circulations and their various applications in oceanography and meteorology.

These principles, which were first described by Sir Isaac Newton in the 18th century, form the basis of our understanding of the behavior of fluids in motion. In this section, we will discuss the equations of motion that govern the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



#### Subsection: 1.2b Navier-Stokes Equations



The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of a fluid in a given flow field. These equations are derived from the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and are widely used in the study of fluid dynamics. In this subsection, we will discuss the Navier-Stokes equations and their applications in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a Newtonian fluid can be written as:



$$

\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t}+( \mathbf u \cdot \nabla ) \mathbf u - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} (\mathbf u,p)=\mathbf 0 & \text{in } \Omega \times (0,T],

\nabla \cdot {\mathbf u}=0 & \text{in } \Omega \times (0,T],

\mathbf u = \mathbf g & \text{on } \Gamma_D \times (0,T],

\boldsymbol{\sigma} (\mathbf u,p) \mathbf{\hat{n}} = \mathbf h & \text{on } \Gamma_N \times (0,T],

\mathbf{u} (\mathbf{x},0) = \mathbf u_0(\mathbf{x})& \text{in } \Omega \times \{0\},

$$



where $\mathbf u$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure field, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, $\mathbf g$ and $\mathbf h$ are the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, and $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$ is the outward directed unit normal vector to the boundary $\Gamma_N$. These equations are subject to the conservation of mass, which states that the divergence of the velocity field must be equal to zero.



The first term in the Navier-Stokes equations represents the acceleration of the fluid particle, while the second term represents the convective acceleration. The third term represents the pressure gradient force, and the last term represents the viscous forces acting on the fluid particle. These equations are nonlinear and coupled, making them difficult to solve analytically. Therefore, numerical methods are often used to solve these equations in practical applications.



The Navier-Stokes equations have many applications in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. They are used to model the behavior of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic flows, such as hurricanes and ocean currents. These equations also play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of weather patterns and climate change. In the next section, we will discuss the applications of the Navier-Stokes equations in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in more detail.





### Section: 1.2 Equations of motion:



The study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres is based on the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics. These principles, which were first described by Sir Isaac Newton in the 18th century, form the basis of our understanding of the behavior of fluids in motion. In this section, we will discuss the equations of motion that govern the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



#### Subsection: 1.2c Euler Equations



The Euler equations are a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations that describe the motion of an inviscid fluid. They are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations by neglecting the viscous terms, which are typically small in geophysical flows. The Euler equations are widely used in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres due to their simplicity and ability to capture the essential dynamics of these systems.



The Euler equations for a compressible fluid can be written as:



$$

\frac{\partial \mathbf{U}}{\partial t}+

\frac{\partial \mathbf{F}}{\partial x}=0,

$$



where $\mathbf{U}$ is a vector of states and $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector of fluxes. These equations represent conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and are subject to an equation of state that relates the pressure, density, and temperature of the fluid.



In order to solve the Euler equations, we must first obtain the left and right extrapolated states for each state variable. This is typically done using a numerical scheme, such as the MUSCL scheme, which is commonly used in atmospheric and oceanic modeling. Once the extrapolated states are known, we can then construct the edge fluxes and solve the semi-discrete scheme to obtain the solution at each time step.



The Euler equations have many applications in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. For example, they are used to model large-scale atmospheric and oceanic flows, such as the global circulation patterns of the Earth. They are also used to study smaller-scale phenomena, such as mesoscale eddies and atmospheric fronts. In addition, the Euler equations are often used as a simplified model for more complex systems, providing insight into the fundamental dynamics of quasi-balanced circulations.

## Chapter: Quasi-Balanced Circulations in Oceans and Atmospheres: A Comprehensive Guide



### Introduction



In this chapter, we will explore the concept of circulation in oceans and atmospheres. Circulation refers to the movement of fluids, such as water and air, in a continuous and cyclical manner. This movement is driven by various factors, including temperature differences, pressure gradients, and the Earth's rotation. Understanding circulation is crucial in studying the dynamics of oceans and atmospheres, as it plays a significant role in shaping our planet's climate and weather patterns.



We will begin by discussing the basic principles of circulation, including the Coriolis effect and the geostrophic balance. These concepts are essential in understanding the quasi-balanced nature of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. We will then delve into the different types of circulation, such as wind-driven and thermohaline circulation, and their respective roles in shaping our planet's climate.



Furthermore, we will explore the various factors that influence circulation, such as topography, land-sea distribution, and atmospheric and oceanic currents. We will also discuss the impact of human activities on circulation patterns and how they can lead to changes in our planet's climate.



Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to circulation in oceans and atmospheres. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the complex and interconnected processes that drive circulation and their crucial role in shaping our planet's climate and weather patterns. 





### Section: 2.1 Potential vorticity:



Potential vorticity is a fundamental concept in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It is a measure of the rotation of a fluid parcel in a flow, and is closely related to the conservation of angular momentum. In this section, we will define potential vorticity and discuss its significance in understanding the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



#### 2.1a Definition of Potential Vorticity



Mathematically, potential vorticity is defined as the ratio of the absolute vorticity to the vertical gradient of potential temperature. In other words, it is a measure of the rotation of a fluid parcel per unit mass, relative to the change in potential temperature with height. This can be expressed as:



$$

q = \frac{\zeta + f}{\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z}}

$$



where $q$ is the potential vorticity, $\zeta$ is the absolute vorticity, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $\theta$ is the potential temperature.



This definition of potential vorticity is particularly useful in understanding the dynamics of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. In a quasi-balanced flow, the potential vorticity is approximately conserved along the flow. This means that as the flow evolves, the potential vorticity remains constant, except for small changes due to friction and diabatic processes.



The conservation of potential vorticity is closely related to the geostrophic balance, which is a fundamental principle in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. The geostrophic balance states that the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are in balance, resulting in a flow that is parallel to the isobars or isotherms. This balance is only possible if the potential vorticity is conserved.



Furthermore, potential vorticity is also related to the evolution of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. The potential vorticity equation, derived from the Navier-Stokes equations, describes how potential vorticity changes over time. This equation is crucial in understanding the dynamics of circulations and how they evolve in response to various factors such as temperature differences, pressure gradients, and the Earth's rotation.



In summary, potential vorticity is a fundamental concept in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. Its definition and conservation play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics and evolution of circulations, and its relationship with the geostrophic balance provides valuable insights into the behavior of these complex systems. In the next section, we will explore the different types of circulations and their respective roles in shaping our planet's climate and weather patterns.

$$



where $q$ is the potential vorticity, $\zeta$ is the absolute vorticity, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $\theta$ is the potential temperature.



This definition of potential vorticity is particularly useful in understanding the dynamics of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. In a quasi-balanced flow, the potential vorticity is approximately conserved along the flow. This means that as the flow evolves, the potential vorticity remains constant, except for small changes due to friction and diabatic processes.



The conservation of potential vorticity is closely related to the geostrophic balance, which is a fundamental principle in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. The geostrophic balance states that the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are in balance, resulting in a flow that is parallel to the isobars or isotherms. This balance is only possible if the potential vorticity is conserved.



Furthermore, potential vorticity is also related to the evolution of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. The potential vorticity equation, derived from the Navier-Stokes equations, describes how potential vorticity changes over time. It takes into account the effects of advection, stretching, and tilting of potential vorticity by the flow, as well as the effects of friction and diabatic processes. This equation is crucial in understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations and their evolution over time.



### Subsection: 2.1b Conservation of Potential Vorticity



As mentioned earlier, potential vorticity is approximately conserved in quasi-balanced flows. This means that the potential vorticity of a fluid parcel remains constant as it moves along the flow, except for small changes due to friction and diabatic processes. This conservation of potential vorticity has important implications for the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



One of the key implications is the relationship between potential vorticity and the geostrophic balance. As mentioned in the previous section, the geostrophic balance is only possible if the potential vorticity is conserved. This is because the geostrophic balance relies on the conservation of angular momentum, which is closely related to potential vorticity. Therefore, the conservation of potential vorticity is a crucial factor in maintaining the geostrophic balance in quasi-balanced flows.



Another important implication of the conservation of potential vorticity is its role in the evolution of circulations. As fluid parcels move along the flow, their potential vorticity remains constant. This means that any changes in the flow, such as advection, stretching, or tilting, must be balanced by changes in other variables, such as velocity or temperature. This balance is crucial in maintaining the stability and structure of quasi-balanced circulations.



In summary, the conservation of potential vorticity is a fundamental concept in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It is closely related to the geostrophic balance and plays a crucial role in the evolution and stability of circulations. In the next section, we will explore the different types of potential vorticity and their applications in understanding the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres.

The potential vorticity equation, derived from the Navier-Stokes equations, describes how potential vorticity changes over time due to various processes such as advection, diffusion, and diabatic heating. This equation is crucial in understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations and their response to external forcings.



### Subsection: 2.1b Potential Vorticity in Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations



Potential vorticity plays a significant role in both oceanic and atmospheric circulations. In the ocean, potential vorticity is conserved along the flow of water masses, which allows for the formation and maintenance of large-scale circulations such as the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). The MOC is a global-scale circulation that transports heat and nutrients around the world, and its strength is closely linked to changes in potential vorticity.



Recent observations from the Rapid Climate Change-Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array have provided valuable insights into the behavior of the MOC. Kanzow et al. (2007) and Cunningham et al. (2007) reported that the MOC is relatively stable, with small variations in transport over time. However, Johns et al. (2009) found that the MOC is highly correlated with changes in meridional heat transport, with the MOC accounting for 90% of the total heat transport. This highlights the importance of potential vorticity in understanding the dynamics of the MOC.



In the atmosphere, potential vorticity is also a crucial factor in the formation and evolution of large-scale circulations. The conservation of potential vorticity allows for the development of strong jet streams and the formation of weather systems such as cyclones and anticyclones. The potential vorticity equation is used extensively in weather forecasting and is a fundamental tool for understanding the behavior of atmospheric circulations.



### Subsection: 2.1c Potential Vorticity in Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations



In both oceanic and atmospheric circulations, potential vorticity is affected by various dynamical mechanisms such as eddy saturation and eddy compensation. Eddy saturation refers to the saturation of eddies in a flow, where the eddies can no longer extract energy from the mean flow. This phenomenon is observed in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), where the mean flow is relatively insensitive to changes in wind forcing due to the presence of strong eddies.



Eddy compensation, on the other hand, refers to the balance between the Ekman transport and eddy-induced transport. In a perfectly compensated flow, the Ekman transport is balanced by the eddy-induced transport, resulting in a near-zero net transport. This mechanism is observed in both the ACC and the MOC, where the mean flow is largely independent of changes in wind forcing.



While eddy saturation and eddy compensation are distinct dynamical mechanisms, they are often linked in oceanic and atmospheric circulations. However, it is important to note that the occurrence of one does not necessarily entail the occurrence of the other. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between these two mechanisms and their impact on potential vorticity in circulations.





### Section: 2.2 Invertibility:



Invertibility is a fundamental concept in the study of functions and their inverses. It is closely related to the concept of bijectivity, which is a property of functions that allows for the existence of an inverse function. In this section, we will define invertibility and discuss its significance in understanding the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



#### 2.2a Definition of Invertibility



Mathematically, a function is invertible if it has a unique inverse function. This means that for every input of the original function, there exists a unique output of the inverse function, and vice versa. In other words, the inverse function "undoes" the original function, and the original function "undoes" the inverse function.



This definition of invertibility is particularly useful in understanding the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. In a quasi-balanced flow, the circulation can be thought of as a function that maps the initial state of the fluid to its final state. The inverse function of this circulation would then map the final state back to the initial state. This concept is closely related to the conservation of potential vorticity, as discussed in the previous section.



The symmetry between a function and its inverse is also important in understanding the dynamics of circulations. This symmetry is expressed in the fact that the inverse of a composition of functions is given by reversing the order of the functions. In the context of circulations, this means that to reverse the effects of a circulation, one must first undo the effects of the final state, and then undo the effects of the initial state.



Furthermore, the concept of self-inverses is also relevant in the study of circulations. A function is equal to its own inverse if and only if the composition of the function with itself is equal to the identity function. In the context of circulations, this means that a circulation that is equal to its own inverse would result in no net change in the fluid state. This is similar to the concept of a steady state in fluid dynamics, where there is no net change in the fluid properties over time.



The graph of the inverse function is also important in understanding the dynamics of circulations. In the context of circulations, the graph of the inverse function can be obtained by switching the positions of the x and y axes. This is equivalent to reflecting the graph across the line of symmetry, which is a useful visualization tool in understanding the effects of circulations on fluid parcels.



In conclusion, the concept of invertibility is crucial in understanding the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It allows us to analyze the effects of circulations and their inverses, and provides a framework for understanding the conservation of potential vorticity and the geostrophic balance.

A function is equal to its own inverse if and only if the composition of the function with itself is equal to the identity function. In the context of circulations, this means that a circulation that is equal to its own inverse would result in a state that is unchanged. This concept is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations, as it allows for the identification of self-inverses and the study of their effects on the fluid dynamics.



#### 2.2b Invertibility Principle in Fluid Dynamics



The invertibility principle is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics that is closely related to the concept of invertibility in mathematics. It states that the dynamics of a fluid can be described by a set of equations that are invertible, meaning that they have a unique solution for every initial condition. This principle is particularly relevant in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres, as it allows for the understanding of the behavior of these circulations and their effects on the fluid.



In the context of fluid dynamics, the invertibility principle can be expressed through the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the motion of a fluid. These equations are invertible, meaning that for every initial condition, there exists a unique solution that describes the behavior of the fluid. This allows for the prediction and understanding of the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres, as well as their effects on the larger-scale weather patterns.



The invertibility principle also plays a crucial role in the development of numerical methods for solving fluid dynamics equations. These methods must preserve the invertibility of the equations in order to accurately simulate the behavior of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. One such method is the Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method, which is commonly used in the study of quasi-balanced circulations. This method ensures that the equations remain invertible and allows for the accurate simulation of fluid dynamics.



In conclusion, the invertibility principle is a fundamental concept in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It allows for the understanding of the behavior of these circulations and their effects on the larger-scale fluid dynamics. The principle also plays a crucial role in the development of numerical methods for solving fluid dynamics equations, ensuring the accuracy of simulations. 





### Section: 2.2 Invertibility:



Invertibility is a fundamental concept in the study of functions and their inverses. It is closely related to the concept of bijectivity, which is a property of functions that allows for the existence of an inverse function. In this section, we will define invertibility and discuss its significance in understanding the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres.

The inverse function of this circulation would then map the final state back to the initial state. This concept is closely related to the conservation of potential vorticity, as discussed in the previous section.

In the context of circulations, this means that to reverse the effects of a circulation, one must first undo the effects of the final state, and then undo the effects of the initial state.



Furthermore, the concept of self-inverses is also relevant in the study of circulations. A function is equal to its own inverse if and only if the composition of the function with itself is equal to the identity function. In the context of circulations, this means that a circulation that is equal to itself after being applied twice is a self-inverse. This concept is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations, as it allows for the identification of self-inverses in the circulation.



### Subsection: 2.2b Properties of Invertibility



In addition to the definition of invertibility, there are several key properties that are important to understand in the context of circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



#### 2.2b.1 Bijectivity



As mentioned earlier, bijectivity is a property of functions that allows for the existence of an inverse function. In the context of circulations, this means that the circulation must be a one-to-one mapping, where each initial state has a unique final state and vice versa. This property is closely related to the conservation of potential vorticity, as it ensures that the potential vorticity is conserved throughout the circulation.



#### 2.2b.2 Symmetry



The symmetry between a function and its inverse is also important in understanding the dynamics of circulations. This symmetry is expressed in the fact that the inverse of a composition of functions is given by reversing the order of the functions. In the context of circulations, this means that to reverse the effects of a circulation, one must first undo the effects of the final state, and then undo the effects of the initial state. This symmetry is crucial in understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations.



#### 2.2b.3 Self-Inverses



As mentioned earlier, self-inverses are functions that are equal to their own inverse. In the context of circulations, this means that a circulation that is equal to itself after being applied twice is a self-inverse. This concept is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations, as it allows for the identification of self-inverses in the circulation. These self-inverses play a crucial role in the dynamics of circulations, as they can act as attractors or repellers for the flow.



### Subsection: 2.2c Applications of Invertibility



The concept of invertibility has many applications in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. Some of these applications include:



#### 2.2c.1 Understanding the Dynamics of Circulations



Invertibility allows for a deeper understanding of the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. By identifying self-inverses and studying their behavior, we can gain insights into the overall behavior of the circulation and its effects on the fluid.

The concept of invertibility can also be used to predict the evolution of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. By understanding the behavior of self-inverses and their effects on the flow, we can make predictions about how the circulation will evolve over time.



#### 2.2c.3 Designing Efficient Circulation Models



Invertibility is also important in the design of efficient circulation models. By understanding the properties of invertibility, we can develop models that accurately represent the behavior of circulations while also being computationally efficient.



In conclusion, invertibility is a fundamental concept in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It allows for a deeper understanding of the dynamics of circulations and has many practical applications in predicting and modeling these circulations. By studying the properties of invertibility, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations and their effects on the fluid.





### Section: 2.3 Potential vorticity and invertibility in the shallow water equations:



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of invertibility and its significance in understanding the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. In this section, we will explore the relationship between invertibility and potential vorticity in the shallow water equations.



#### 2.3a Shallow Water Equations



The shallow water equations are a set of equations that describe the motion of a fluid in a horizontal bed, neglecting Coriolis forces, frictional and viscous forces. These equations are derived from the conservation of mass and momentum, and they hold even when the assumptions of shallow water break down, such as across a hydraulic jump.



The first equation in the shallow water equations represents the conservation of mass, where $\eta$ is the total fluid column height and the 2D vector ($u,v$) is the fluid's horizontal flow velocity averaged across the vertical column. The second and third equations represent the conservation of momentum in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.



The shallow water equations can be written in both conservative and non-conservative forms. The conservative form is obtained by using the product rule, while the non-conservative form includes terms for Coriolis, frictional, and viscous forces. In both forms, the equations are valid for constant fluid density.



#### 2.3b Potential Vorticity



Potential vorticity is a fundamental concept in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It is defined as the ratio of absolute vorticity to the fluid's depth, and it is conserved in a quasi-balanced flow. This means that the potential vorticity remains constant as the fluid moves, and it can be used to understand the dynamics of circulations.



In the shallow water equations, potential vorticity is closely related to the conservation of mass and momentum. The conservation of mass equation can be rewritten in terms of potential vorticity, where the total fluid column height $\eta$ is replaced by the potential vorticity $\zeta$. This equation is known as the potential vorticity equation and is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



#### 2.3c Invertibility and Potential Vorticity



The concept of invertibility is closely related to potential vorticity in the shallow water equations. In a quasi-balanced flow, the circulation can be thought of as a function that maps the initial state of the fluid to its final state. The inverse function of this circulation would then map the final state back to the initial state. This is similar to the concept of potential vorticity, where the potential vorticity remains constant as the fluid moves.



Furthermore, the symmetry between a function and its inverse is also relevant in understanding the dynamics of circulations. This symmetry is expressed in the fact that the inverse of a composition of functions is given by reversing the order of the functions. In the context of circulations, this means that to reverse the effects of a circulation, one must first undo the effects of the final state, and then undo the effects of the initial state. This is similar to the concept of potential vorticity, where the potential vorticity remains constant as the fluid moves.



In conclusion, the shallow water equations and potential vorticity are closely related to the concept of invertibility. Understanding this relationship is crucial in comprehending the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. In the next section, we will explore the applications of these concepts in real-world scenarios.

#### 2.3a Shallow Water Equations



The shallow water equations are a set of equations that describe the motion of a fluid in a horizontal bed, neglecting Coriolis forces, frictional and viscous forces. These equations are derived from the conservation of mass and momentum, and they hold even when the assumptions of shallow water break down, such as across a hydraulic jump.



The first equation in the shallow water equations represents the conservation of mass, where $\eta$ is the total fluid column height and the 2D vector ($u,v$) is the fluid's horizontal flow velocity averaged across the vertical column. The second and third equations represent the conservation of momentum in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.



The shallow water equations can be written in both conservative and non-conservative forms. The conservative form is obtained by using the product rule, while the non-conservative form includes terms for Coriolis, frictional, and viscous forces. In both forms, the equations are valid for constant fluid density.



#### 2.3b Potential Vorticity in Shallow Water



Potential vorticity is a fundamental concept in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It is defined as the ratio of absolute vorticity to the fluid's depth, and it is conserved in a quasi-balanced flow. This means that the potential vorticity remains constant as the fluid moves, and it can be used to understand the dynamics of circulations.



In the shallow water equations, potential vorticity is closely related to the conservation of mass and momentum. The conservation of mass equation can be rewritten in terms of potential vorticity, as shown in equation (3) in the related context. This equation highlights the importance of potential vorticity in understanding the dynamics of circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



Furthermore, potential vorticity can also be used to understand the effects of horizontal convergence and divergence on the circulation. As mentioned in the related context, convergence leads to an increase in potential vorticity, while divergence leads to a decrease. This relationship between potential vorticity and horizontal flow can help us understand the behavior of circulations in different scenarios.



In summary, potential vorticity is a crucial concept in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. Its conservation in quasi-balanced flows and its relationship with the shallow water equations make it a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of circulations. In the next section, we will explore the concept of potential vorticity further and its applications in different scenarios.

#### 2.3c Invertibility in Shallow Water



Invertibility is a key concept in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It refers to the ability of a flow to be described by a single stream function, which is a mathematical function that describes the velocity field of a fluid. Invertibility is closely related to the conservation of mass and momentum in the shallow water equations.



The shallow water equations are a set of equations that describe the motion of a fluid in a horizontal bed, neglecting Coriolis forces, frictional and viscous forces.

In both forms, the equations are valid for constant fluid density.



In the shallow water equations, invertibility is closely related to the conservation of mass and momentum. The conservation of mass equation can be rewritten in terms of the stream function, which allows for the description of the flow in terms of a single function. This is known as the invertibility condition, and it is a necessary condition for the existence of a stream function.



Potential vorticity is a fundamental concept in the study of circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It is defined as the ratio of absolute vorticity to the fluid's depth, and it is conserved in a quasi-balanced flow. This means that the potential vorticity remains constant as the fluid moves, and it can be used to understand the dynamics of circulations.



In the shallow water equations, potential vorticity is closely related to the conservation of mass and momentum. The conservation of mass equation can be rewritten in terms of the potential vorticity, which allows for the description of the flow in terms of a single function.

The shallow water equations provide a framework for understanding these concepts and their significance in describing the dynamics of circulations. In the next section, we will explore the applications of these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Chapter: Quasi-Balanced Circulations in Oceans and Atmospheres: A Comprehensive Guide



### Introduction



In this chapter, we will delve into the concept of quasigeostrophy and pseudo-potential vorticity in the context of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. These concepts are crucial in understanding the dynamics of large-scale flows in these systems. Quasigeostrophy is a simplified form of the geostrophic balance, which is a fundamental principle in the study of ocean and atmospheric dynamics. It allows us to understand the behavior of large-scale flows by considering the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Pseudo-potential vorticity, on the other hand, is a diagnostic tool that helps us identify regions of strong vorticity and potential for the development of instabilities in the flow.



We will begin by discussing the basics of quasigeostrophy and how it differs from the geostrophic balance. We will then explore the implications of this simplified balance on the dynamics of large-scale flows in oceans and atmospheres. This will include a discussion on the role of Rossby waves and their importance in maintaining the quasigeostrophic balance. We will also touch upon the limitations of quasigeostrophy and when it may not be applicable in certain scenarios.



Moving on, we will introduce the concept of pseudo-potential vorticity and its relationship with quasigeostrophy. We will discuss how this diagnostic tool can be used to identify regions of strong vorticity and potential for the development of instabilities in the flow. This will include a discussion on the different types of instabilities that can arise in quasi-balanced circulations and their implications on the overall flow.



Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of quasigeostrophy and pseudo-potential vorticity in the context of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in these concepts and their applications in the study of large-scale flows in these systems. 





## Chapter 3: Quasigeostrophy and Pseudo-potential vorticity



### Section: 3.1 Quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity



The concept of quasigeostrophy is a simplified form of the geostrophic balance, which is a fundamental principle in the study of ocean and atmospheric dynamics. It allows us to understand the behavior of large-scale flows by considering the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of quasigeostrophy and its implications on the dynamics of large-scale flows.



#### 3.1a Definition of Quasi-Geostrophic Potential Vorticity



To understand quasigeostrophy, we must first understand the geostrophic balance. In Cartesian coordinates, the components of the geostrophic wind are given by:



$$

u_g = -\frac{1}{f_0}\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y}

$$



$$

v_g = \frac{1}{f_0}\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x}

$$



where $\Phi$ is the geopotential. The geostrophic vorticity can then be expressed in terms of the geopotential as:



$$

\zeta_g = \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{f_0}\left(\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial y^2}\right)

$$



This equation can be used to find $\zeta_g$ from a known field $\Phi$, or to determine $\Phi$ from a known distribution of $\zeta_g$ by inverting the Laplacian operator.



The quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation can be obtained from the $x$ and $y$ components of the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation, which can be derived from the horizontal momentum equation:



$$

\frac{D\mathbf{V}}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{F}

$$



where $\mathbf{V}$ is the horizontal velocity, $\rho$ is the density, $p$ is the pressure, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $\mathbf{F}$ is the frictional force. The material derivative in this equation is defined by:



$$

\frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{V}\cdot\nabla

$$



The horizontal velocity $\mathbf{V}$ can be separated into a geostrophic component $\mathbf{V_g}$ and an ageostrophic component $\mathbf{V_a}$:



$$

\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V_g} + \mathbf{V_a}

$$



Two important assumptions of the quasi-geostrophic approximation are:



1. The Rossby number $Ro$ and the topographic Rossby number $Ro_T$ are much smaller than 1, i.e. $Ro, Ro_T \ll 1$.

2. The Coriolis parameter $f$ is approximately constant, with a small variation given by $\beta y$.



The second assumption justifies letting the Coriolis parameter have a constant value $f_0$ in the geostrophic approximation and approximating its variation in the Coriolis force term by $f_0 + \beta y$. However, because the acceleration following the motion, which is given in the horizontal momentum equation as the difference between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, depends on the departure of the actual wind from the geostrophic wind, it is not permissible to simply replace the velocity by its geostrophic velocity in the Coriolis term.



### Subsection: 3.1b Implications of Quasi-Geostrophy on Large-Scale Flows



The quasi-geostrophic approximation has important implications on the dynamics of large-scale flows in oceans and atmospheres. One of the key implications is the role of Rossby waves in maintaining the quasigeostrophic balance. Rossby waves are large-scale planetary waves that are essential in redistributing energy and momentum in the atmosphere and oceans. In the quasi-geostrophic approximation, these waves are considered to be in geostrophic balance, with the Coriolis force balancing the pressure gradient force.



However, it is important to note that the quasi-geostrophic approximation has its limitations and may not be applicable in certain scenarios. For example, it does not take into account the effects of small-scale processes such as turbulence and mixing, which can significantly impact the dynamics of large-scale flows. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the assumptions and limitations of the quasi-geostrophic approximation when applying it to real-world situations.



### Section: 3.2 Pseudo-Potential Vorticity



Pseudo-potential vorticity is a diagnostic tool that helps us identify regions of strong vorticity and potential for the development of instabilities in the flow. It is defined as:



$$

PV = \frac{\zeta + f}{H}

$$



where $\zeta$ is the absolute vorticity, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $H$ is the depth of the fluid layer. Pseudo-potential vorticity is conserved in the absence of friction and diabatic processes, making it a useful tool for studying the dynamics of large-scale flows.



Pseudo-potential vorticity is closely related to quasigeostrophy, as it is derived from the quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation. It can be used to identify regions of strong vorticity and potential for the development of instabilities, such as baroclinic and barotropic instabilities. These instabilities can have significant impacts on the overall flow, leading to the formation of eddies and other features.



In conclusion, quasigeostrophy and pseudo-potential vorticity are important concepts in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. They provide valuable insights into the dynamics of large-scale flows and can help us understand the behavior of these systems. However, it is important to carefully consider the assumptions and limitations of these concepts when applying them to real-world situations. 





## Chapter 3: Quasigeostrophy and Pseudo-potential vorticity



### Section: 3.1 Quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity



The concept of quasigeostrophy is a simplified form of the geostrophic balance, which is a fundamental principle in the study of ocean and atmospheric dynamics. It allows us to understand the behavior of large-scale flows by considering the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of quasigeostrophy and its implications on the dynamics of large-scale flows.



#### 3.1a Definition of Quasi-Geostrophic Potential Vorticity



To understand quasigeostrophy, we must first understand the geostrophic balance. In Cartesian coordinates, the components of the geostrophic wind are given by:



$$

u_g = -\frac{1}{f_0}\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y}

$$



$$

v_g = \frac{1}{f_0}\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x}

$$



where $\Phi$ is the geopotential. The geostrophic vorticity can then be expressed in terms of the geopotential as:



$$

\zeta_g = \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{f_0}\left(\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial y^2}\right)

$$



This equation can be used to find $\zeta_g$ from a known field $\Phi$, or to determine $\Phi$ from a known distribution of $\zeta_g$ by inverting the Laplacian operator.



The quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation can be obtained from the $x$ and $y$ components of the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation, which can be derived from the horizontal momentum equation:



$$

\frac{D\mathbf{V}}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{F}

$$



where $\mathbf{V}$ is the horizontal velocity, $\rho$ is the density, $p$ is the pressure, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $\mathbf{F}$ is the frictional force. The material derivative in this equation is defined by:



$$

\frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{V}\cdot\nabla

$$



The horizontal velocity $\mathbf{V}$ can be decomposed into a geostrophic component and an ageostrophic component, such that $\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V}_g + \mathbf{V}_a$. The geostrophic component is defined as:



$$

\mathbf{V}_g = \frac{1}{f_0}\nabla \times \Phi

$$



where $\Phi$ is the geopotential. The ageostrophic component is defined as:



$$

\mathbf{V}_a = \frac{1}{\rho f_0}\nabla \times \mathbf{F}

$$



Substituting these definitions into the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation and neglecting terms where small component terms ($\mathbf{V}_a, \nabla \times \mathbf{V}_a, \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ and $\alpha_0$) are multiplied, we obtain:



$$

\frac{\partial \mathbf{V}_g}{\partial t} + \mathbf{V}_g \cdot \nabla \mathbf{V}_g + f_0 \hat{z} \times \mathbf{V}_g = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \mathbf{g}

$$



This equation can be further simplified by using the geostrophic balance, which states that the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are in balance. This allows us to neglect the pressure gradient term, resulting in the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation:



$$

\frac{\partial \zeta_g}{\partial t} + \mathbf{V}_g \cdot \nabla \zeta_g + f_0 \hat{z} \cdot \nabla \times \mathbf{V}_g = 0

$$



This equation shows that the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity is conserved along the flow, as long as the flow remains in geostrophic balance. This conservation is known as the potential vorticity conservation theorem.



#### 3.1b Conservation of Quasi-Geostrophic Potential Vorticity



The conservation of quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity has important implications for the dynamics of large-scale flows in oceans and atmospheres. It allows us to understand the behavior of these flows by considering the conservation of potential vorticity, rather than the individual components of the flow. This simplifies the analysis and allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics at play.



Furthermore, the conservation of quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity also leads to the formation of Rossby waves, which are large-scale waves that propagate in the ocean and atmosphere due to the conservation of potential vorticity. These waves play a crucial role in the transport of energy and momentum, and have significant impacts on weather patterns and ocean currents.



In summary, the conservation of quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity is a fundamental concept in the study of large-scale flows in oceans and atmospheres. It allows us to simplify the analysis and gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play, and has important implications for the formation of Rossby waves and the transport of energy and momentum. 





## Chapter 3: Quasigeostrophy and Pseudo-potential vorticity



### Section: 3.1 Quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity



The concept of quasigeostrophy is a simplified form of the geostrophic balance, which is a fundamental principle in the study of ocean and atmospheric dynamics. It allows us to understand the behavior of large-scale flows by considering the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of quasigeostrophy and its implications on the dynamics of large-scale flows.



#### 3.1a Definition of Quasi-Geostrophic Potential Vorticity



To understand quasigeostrophy, we must first understand the geostrophic balance. In Cartesian coordinates, the components of the geostrophic wind are given by:



$$

u_g = -\frac{1}{f_0}\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y}

$$



$$

v_g = \frac{1}{f_0}\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x}

$$



where $\Phi$ is the geopotential. The geostrophic vorticity can then be expressed in terms of the geopotential as:



$$

\zeta_g = \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{f_0}\left(\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial y^2}\right)

$$



This equation can be used to find $\zeta_g$ from a known field $\Phi$, or to determine $\Phi$ from a known distribution of $\zeta_g$ by inverting the Laplacian operator.



The quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation can be obtained from the $x$ and $y$ components of the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation, which can be derived from the horizontal momentum equation:



$$

\frac{D\mathbf{V}}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{F}

$$



where $\mathbf{V}$ is the horizontal velocity, $\rho$ is the density, $p$ is the pressure, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $\mathbf{F}$ is the frictional force. The material derivative in this equation is defined by:



$$

\frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{V}\cdot\nabla

$$



The horizontal velocity $\mathbf{V}$ can be decomposed into a geostrophic component and a non-geostrophic component, such that $\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V}_g + \mathbf{V}_n$. The geostrophic component is defined as:



$$

\mathbf{V}_g = \frac{1}{f_0}\nabla \times \Phi

$$



Substituting this into the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation and neglecting the non-geostrophic terms, we obtain the quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation:



$$

\frac{\partial \zeta_g}{\partial t} + \mathbf{V}_g \cdot \nabla \zeta_g = \frac{1}{f_0}\nabla \times \left(\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p\right) + \mathbf{F}_g

$$



where $\mathbf{F}_g$ is the geostrophic component of the frictional force. This equation is known as the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation.



#### 3.1b Implications of Quasi-Geostrophic Potential Vorticity



The quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation has important implications for the dynamics of large-scale flows in oceans and atmospheres. One of the key implications is the conservation of potential vorticity in quasi-geostrophic flows. This means that the potential vorticity remains constant along a fluid parcel's path, unless it is acted upon by external forces.



This conservation of potential vorticity has important consequences for the formation and evolution of large-scale circulations. For example, in the ocean, the potential vorticity of a water parcel is determined by its density and the strength of the Coriolis force. As water parcels move along isopycnal surfaces, their potential vorticity remains constant, leading to the formation of large-scale gyres and currents.



In the atmosphere, the potential vorticity is determined by the temperature and the strength of the Coriolis force. As air parcels move along isentropic surfaces, their potential vorticity remains constant, leading to the formation of large-scale weather systems and jet streams.



### Subsection: 3.1c Applications in Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations



The concept of quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity has numerous applications in the study of oceanic and atmospheric circulations. One of the most significant applications is in understanding the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the Atlantic Ocean.



The MOC is a large-scale circulation pattern that transports warm water from the tropics to the high latitudes and cold water from the high latitudes to the tropics. This circulation is driven by the density differences between warm and cold water, and is influenced by the Coriolis force. The conservation of potential vorticity plays a crucial role in maintaining the MOC, as it ensures that the water parcels maintain their potential vorticity as they move along the circulation.



Recent observations from the Rapid Climate Change-Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array have provided valuable insights into the behavior of the MOC. These observations have shown that the MOC is highly variable, with a root-mean-square value of only 3.4 Sv (where 1 Sv = a flow of ocean water of 10<sup>6</sup> cubic meters per second) over a year. This variability is influenced by changes in the strength of the MOC, which is highly correlated with changes in the meridional heat transport.



The concept of quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity also has applications in understanding the convection and entrainment processes in the Labrador Sea. This region is known for its characteristic fresh water formation at intermediate depths, which is driven by deep convection during winter storms. The conservation of potential vorticity plays a crucial role in the formation and entrainment of this fresh water, as it ensures that the water parcels maintain their potential vorticity as they move along the circulation. This has important implications for the distribution of fresh water in the Labrador Sea and its impact on the larger oceanic circulation patterns.



In conclusion, the concept of quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity is a powerful tool in understanding the dynamics of large-scale flows in oceans and atmospheres. Its applications in various oceanic and atmospheric circulations have provided valuable insights into the behavior and variability of these systems. Further research and observations in this field will continue to enhance our understanding of these complex and dynamic systems.





## Chapter 3: Quasigeostrophy and Pseudo-potential vorticity



### Section: 3.2 An example of the application of 'potential vorticity':



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of quasigeostrophy and its implications on the dynamics of large-scale flows. In this section, we will explore an example of the application of potential vorticity, a key concept in quasigeostrophy.



#### 3.2a Case Study: Oceanic Circulation



The ocean is a complex system with many different processes and interactions occurring simultaneously. One of the key processes that drives oceanic circulation is the formation of water masses through convection and entrainment. This process is particularly important in the Labrador Sea, where fresh Labrador Sea Water (LSW) is formed at intermediate depths through deep convection during winter storms.



LSW is characterized by its low salinity and joins North Atlantic Central Water (NACW) to form North Atlantic Subpolar Water (NSPW). This water mass then moves southward out of the Labrador Sea, with some LSW being retained near the Greenland-Scotland Ridge (GSR) due to the Subpolar Gyre (SPG). This retention and diversion of LSW explains its presence and entrainment near the GSR overflows.



The production of LSW is highly dependent on sea-air heat flux, with yearly production typically ranging from 3-9 Sv. This production also affects the downstream density gradient, which in turn impacts the production of Intermediate Salinity Water (ISOW) through the Iceland-Scotland Ridge. Therefore, changes in LSW production can have a significant impact on the overall oceanic circulation.



However, the role of convection in the Labrador Sea in driving the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is still a topic of debate. Some observational studies have shown a connection between Labrador Sea variability and AMOC variability, while others have found little contribution from the Labrador Sea to overturning. This highlights the complexity of the oceanic circulation and the need for further research in this area.



In conclusion, the example of oceanic circulation in the Labrador Sea demonstrates the application of potential vorticity in understanding and predicting large-scale flows. By considering the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, we can gain insights into the dynamics of the ocean and its impact on global climate patterns.

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of quasigeostrophy and its implications on the dynamics of large-scale flows. In this section, we will explore an example of the application of potential vorticity, a key concept in quasigeostrophy.



#### 3.2b Case Study: Atmospheric Circulation



Atmospheric circulation is a complex system that plays a crucial role in shaping our weather patterns and climate. One of the key processes that drives atmospheric circulation is the formation and movement of air masses. This process is particularly important in the North Atlantic region, where the interaction between the ocean and atmosphere plays a significant role in shaping the circulation patterns.



The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern that is characterized by the pressure difference between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. This pressure difference drives the westerly winds that dominate the mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic. The NAO is known to have a significant impact on weather patterns in Europe and North America, with a positive phase leading to warmer and wetter conditions in Europe and colder and drier conditions in North America, and vice versa for a negative phase.



The NAO is closely linked to the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which is the oceanic component of the global thermohaline circulation. The AMOC is driven by the formation of deep water masses in the North Atlantic, particularly in the Labrador Sea. These deep water masses, such as Labrador Sea Water (LSW), are characterized by their low salinity and high density, and play a crucial role in driving the AMOC.



The production of LSW is highly dependent on the sea-air heat flux, which is influenced by the NAO. During a positive phase of the NAO, the westerly winds are stronger, leading to increased heat transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere. This results in a decrease in the production of LSW, which in turn affects the density gradient and circulation patterns in the North Atlantic.



However, the exact role of the NAO in driving the AMOC is still a topic of debate. Some studies have shown a strong connection between the NAO and AMOC variability, while others have found little contribution from the NAO to the overturning circulation. This highlights the complexity of the atmospheric-oceanic interactions and the need for further research in this area.



In conclusion, the application of potential vorticity in atmospheric circulation is crucial in understanding the dynamics of large-scale flows and their impact on weather patterns and climate. The NAO and its relationship with the AMOC serve as a prime example of the complex interactions between the ocean and atmosphere and the role they play in shaping our world. 





## Chapter 3: Quasigeostrophy and Pseudo-potential vorticity



### Section: 3.2 An example of the application of 'potential vorticity':



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of quasigeostrophy and its implications on the dynamics of large-scale flows. In this section, we will explore an example of the application of potential vorticity, a key concept in quasigeostrophy.



#### 3.2c Analysis and Interpretation



In the study of ocean and atmospheric circulations, potential vorticity is a crucial concept that helps us understand the dynamics of these complex systems. It is defined as the ratio of the absolute vorticity to the thickness of the fluid layer, and is conserved in an inviscid, adiabatic flow. This conservation of potential vorticity is known as the potential vorticity conservation law.



One of the most significant applications of potential vorticity is in the study of atmospheric circulation, particularly in the North Atlantic region. As mentioned in the previous section, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern that is driven by the pressure difference between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. This pressure difference, in turn, is influenced by the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).



The AMOC is driven by the formation of deep water masses in the North Atlantic, particularly in the Labrador Sea. These deep water masses, such as Labrador Sea Water (LSW), are characterized by their low salinity and high density, and play a crucial role in driving the AMOC. The production of LSW is highly dependent on the sea-air heat flux, which is influenced by the NAO.



Using the concept of potential vorticity, we can analyze and interpret the relationship between the NAO and the AMOC. During a positive phase of the NAO, the westerly winds are stronger, leading to increased heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere. This results in a decrease in the thickness of the fluid layer, leading to an increase in potential vorticity. This increase in potential vorticity then leads to a strengthening of the AMOC, as the conservation of potential vorticity requires a decrease in the absolute vorticity to compensate for the decrease in thickness.



On the other hand, during a negative phase of the NAO, the westerly winds are weaker, resulting in a decrease in heat flux and an increase in the thickness of the fluid layer. This leads to a decrease in potential vorticity and a weakening of the AMOC. This analysis highlights the crucial role that potential vorticity plays in the dynamics of ocean and atmospheric circulations, and how it can help us understand the complex interactions between these systems.



In conclusion, the application of potential vorticity in the study of ocean and atmospheric circulations is a powerful tool that allows us to analyze and interpret the dynamics of these complex systems. By understanding the relationship between potential vorticity and other key variables, such as the NAO and the AMOC, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of these systems and their impact on our weather patterns and climate. 





## Chapter 3: Quasigeostrophy and Pseudo-potential vorticity



### Section: 3.3 Boundary conditions



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of potential vorticity and its application in understanding atmospheric circulations. In this section, we will explore the importance of boundary conditions in the study of quasigeostrophic flows.



#### 3.3a Definition of Boundary Conditions



Boundary conditions play a crucial role in determining the behavior of quasigeostrophic flows. These conditions specify the values of the flow variables at the boundaries of the fluid domain, and are essential in solving the governing equations of motion.



In the case of ocean and atmospheric circulations, the boundaries are often defined by the coastlines and the topography of the ocean floor. These boundaries can significantly influence the flow patterns and can lead to the formation of eddies and other complex features.



One of the most commonly used boundary conditions in quasigeostrophic flows is the no-slip condition, which states that the fluid velocity at the boundary is zero. This condition is often applied at the ocean floor, where the friction between the fluid and the solid surface leads to a decrease in velocity.



Another important boundary condition is the no-penetration condition, which states that the fluid cannot penetrate through the boundary. This condition is often applied at the coastlines, where the fluid is confined to a specific region and cannot flow beyond it.



In addition to these two conditions, there are other boundary conditions that can be applied depending on the specific problem being studied. These conditions can include the specification of temperature or salinity at the boundaries, or the inclusion of external forcing such as wind stress.



Understanding and properly defining boundary conditions is crucial in accurately modeling and predicting quasigeostrophic flows. These conditions can significantly impact the behavior of the flow and must be carefully considered in any analysis or interpretation.

### Subsection: 3.3b Boundary Conditions in Fluid Dynamics



In fluid dynamics, boundary conditions are essential in determining the behavior of a fluid flow. They are used to specify the values of the flow variables at the boundaries of the fluid domain, and are crucial in solving the governing equations of motion.



#### Types of Boundary Conditions



There are several types of boundary conditions that can be applied in fluid dynamics, depending on the specific problem being studied. Some of the most commonly used boundary conditions include:



- No-slip condition: This condition states that the fluid velocity at the boundary is zero. It is often applied at solid boundaries, such as the ocean floor, where the friction between the fluid and the solid surface leads to a decrease in velocity.



- No-penetration condition: This condition states that the fluid cannot penetrate through the boundary. It is often applied at the boundaries of a confined fluid, such as coastlines, where the fluid is restricted to a specific region.



- Specified values: In some cases, the values of certain flow variables, such as temperature or salinity, may be specified at the boundaries. This can be important in studying the effects of these variables on the overall flow.



- External forcing: In addition to the boundaries of the fluid domain, external forces can also be applied to the fluid. This can include wind stress, which can significantly impact the behavior of the flow.



#### Importance of Boundary Conditions in Quasigeostrophic Flows



In the study of quasigeostrophic flows, boundary conditions play a crucial role in determining the behavior of the flow. The boundaries of the fluid domain, such as coastlines and ocean floor topography, can significantly influence the flow patterns and lead to the formation of complex features.



Properly defining and understanding boundary conditions is crucial in accurately modeling and predicting quasigeostrophic flows. Neglecting or incorrectly specifying these conditions can lead to inaccurate results and hinder our understanding of these important circulations in oceans and atmospheres.





### Section: 3.3 Boundary conditions



In the previous section, we discussed the importance of boundary conditions in quasigeostrophic flows. In this section, we will focus specifically on boundary conditions in quasi-balanced circulations.



#### 3.3c Boundary Conditions in Quasi-Balanced Circulations



Boundary conditions play a crucial role in determining the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. These conditions specify the values of the flow variables at the boundaries of the fluid domain, and are essential in solving the governing equations of motion.



One of the most commonly used boundary conditions in quasi-balanced circulations is the no-slip condition, which states that the fluid velocity at the boundary is zero. This condition is often applied at the ocean floor, where the friction between the fluid and the solid surface leads to a decrease in velocity. In the case of atmospheric circulations, this condition can be applied at the Earth's surface, where friction with the land or water surface slows down the flow.



Another important boundary condition is the no-penetration condition, which states that the fluid cannot penetrate through the boundary. This condition is often applied at the coastlines, where the fluid is confined to a specific region and cannot flow beyond it. In the case of atmospheric circulations, this condition can also be applied at the top of the atmosphere, where the fluid is confined by the stratosphere.



In addition to these two conditions, there are other boundary conditions that can be applied depending on the specific problem being studied. These conditions can include the specification of temperature or salinity at the boundaries, or the inclusion of external forcing such as wind stress. For example, in the case of ocean circulations, the specification of temperature and salinity at the boundaries can be important in understanding the formation of ocean currents and their interactions with the atmosphere.



Understanding and properly defining boundary conditions is crucial in accurately modeling and predicting quasi-balanced circulations. These conditions can significantly impact the behavior of the flow and must be carefully considered in order to obtain accurate results. In the next section, we will explore the application of boundary conditions in specific examples of quasi-balanced circulations.





### Section: 3.4 Eady edge waves:



Eady edge waves, also known as baroclinic waves, are a type of internal wave that occur in the ocean and atmosphere. These waves are named after Sir James Lighthill and Peter Eady, who first described them in the 1940s. Eady edge waves are important in understanding the dynamics of quasi-balanced circulations, as they play a significant role in the transfer of energy and momentum between different layers of the fluid.



#### 3.4a Definition of Eady Edge Waves



Eady edge waves are a type of internal wave that occur at the interface between two layers of fluid with different densities. In the ocean, these layers are often formed by differences in temperature and salinity, while in the atmosphere, they are formed by differences in temperature and humidity. These waves are characterized by their horizontal wavelength, which is typically on the order of hundreds of kilometers, and their vertical wavelength, which is on the order of a few kilometers.



Eady edge waves are a type of inertia-gravity wave, meaning that they are affected by both the Coriolis force and the buoyancy force. This makes them different from other types of internal waves, such as Kelvin waves, which are only affected by the Coriolis force. The combination of these two forces leads to the propagation of Eady edge waves along the interface between the two layers of fluid.



In the ocean, Eady edge waves are often observed in the thermocline, which is the layer of water that separates the warm, well-mixed surface layer from the colder, deeper layer. In the atmosphere, these waves are observed in the tropopause, which is the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Eady edge waves can also occur in other regions of the ocean and atmosphere where there are sharp density gradients, such as at the edges of ocean currents or in the jet streams of the atmosphere.



The propagation of Eady edge waves is governed by the Eady equation, which is a simplified form of the quasigeostrophic potential vorticity equation. This equation describes the evolution of the pseudo-potential vorticity, which is a measure of the rotation and stratification of the fluid. The Eady equation takes into account the effects of both the Coriolis force and the buoyancy force, as well as the effects of friction and diffusion.



In summary, Eady edge waves are a type of internal wave that occur at the interface between two layers of fluid with different densities. These waves play a crucial role in the dynamics of quasi-balanced circulations, and their study is essential in understanding the transfer of energy and momentum between different layers of the fluid. In the next section, we will explore the properties and behavior of Eady edge waves in more detail.

Eady edge waves can also occur in other regions of the ocean and atmosphere where there are sharp density gradients, such as at the edges of ocean currents or in the jet streams of the atmosphere.



The propagation of Eady edge waves is governed by the Eady equation, which is a simplified form of the quasi-geostrophic equations. These equations describe the motion of a fluid in a rotating frame of reference, taking into account the effects of the Coriolis force and the buoyancy force. In the case of Eady edge waves, the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid, and the density variations are small. This allows for the derivation of a simplified equation that describes the evolution of the interface between the two layers of fluid.



### Subsection: 3.4b Formation and Propagation of Eady Edge Waves



Eady edge waves are formed when there is a disturbance at the interface between two layers of fluid with different densities. This disturbance can be caused by a variety of factors, such as wind forcing, changes in temperature or salinity, or topographic features. Once the disturbance is present, the Eady edge waves will propagate along the interface, with the energy and momentum being transferred between the two layers of fluid.



The speed at which Eady edge waves propagate is determined by the properties of the two layers of fluid, specifically their density and the strength of the Coriolis force. In general, Eady edge waves will propagate faster in regions where the density difference between the two layers is larger, and the Coriolis force is stronger. This means that Eady edge waves will typically propagate faster in the ocean than in the atmosphere, as the density differences between water masses are often larger than those between air masses.



The vertical structure of Eady edge waves is also important in understanding their formation and propagation. These waves have a characteristic vertical wavelength, which is determined by the density difference between the two layers of fluid. In regions where the density difference is larger, the vertical wavelength will be shorter, and the waves will be more tightly packed. This can lead to the formation of wave packets, where multiple Eady edge waves are present in a small region.



In summary, Eady edge waves are a type of internal wave that occur at the interface between two layers of fluid with different densities. They are important in understanding the dynamics of quasi-balanced circulations, and their formation and propagation are governed by the Eady equation. These waves play a significant role in the transfer of energy and momentum between different layers of the fluid, and their properties are determined by the density difference and the strength of the Coriolis force.

Eady edge waves can also occur in other regions of the ocean and atmosphere where there are sharp density gradients, such as at the edges of ocean currents or in the jet streams of the atmosphere.



The propagation of Eady edge waves is governed by the Eady equation, which is a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations. This equation describes the evolution of the vertical vorticity of the fluid, which is a measure of the rotation of the fluid. In the case of Eady edge waves, the vorticity is generated by the horizontal shear of the flow at the interface between the two layers of fluid. This shear is caused by the differences in density between the two layers, which leads to a difference in the Coriolis force acting on the fluid.



The Eady equation can be written as:



$$

{\partial \over \partial t} \left( {\partial \eta \over \partial t} - R^2 \nabla^2 \eta \right) + \alpha_0 {g \over f_0} {\partial \eta \over \partial x} = 0

$$



where $\eta$ is the vertical displacement of the interface, $R$ is the Rossby number, $\alpha_0$ is the thermal expansion coefficient, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $f_0$ is the Coriolis parameter. This equation shows that the evolution of the vertical vorticity is dependent on the time rate of change of the vertical displacement and the horizontal gradient of the displacement. It also shows that the thermal expansion coefficient and the Coriolis parameter play a significant role in the propagation of Eady edge waves.



In summary, Eady edge waves are a type of internal wave that occur at the interface between two layers of fluid with different densities. They are important in understanding the dynamics of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres, and their propagation is governed by the Eady equation. These waves play a crucial role in the transfer of energy and momentum between different layers of the fluid, making them a key component in the study of quasi-balanced circulations.





### Section: 3.5 The superposition principle:



The superposition principle is a fundamental concept in the study of linear systems, which are systems that can be described by linear equations. It states that the net response of a system to multiple stimuli is equal to the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually. This principle is applicable to a wide range of physical systems, including algebraic equations, linear differential equations, and systems of equations.



#### 3.5a Definition of Superposition Principle



A function <math>F(x)</math> satisfies the superposition principle if it is a linear function, meaning it satisfies the properties of additivity and homogeneity. Additivity states that the function's response to the sum of two inputs is equal to the sum of the individual responses, while homogeneity states that the function's response to a scaled input is equal to the scaled response of the original input. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:



<math display="block">F(x_1+x_2)=F(x_1)+F(x_2) \,</math>

<math display="block">F(a x)=a F(x) \,</math>



where `a` is a scalar.



The superposition principle has many applications in physics and engineering, as many physical systems can be modeled as linear systems. For example, a beam can be modeled as a linear system where the input stimulus is the load on the beam and the output response is the deflection of the beam. This principle is particularly useful because linear systems are easier to analyze mathematically, and there are a variety of mathematical techniques that can be applied to them.



It is important to note that the superposition principle is an approximation of the true physical behavior, as most physical systems are only approximately linear. However, it is still a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing these systems.



The superposition principle applies to "any" linear system, including those involving vectors or vector fields. In these cases, the superposition is interpreted as a vector sum. Additionally, any linear operations applied to these functions, such as gradients, differentials, or integrals, will also follow the superposition principle.



In summary, the superposition principle is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing linear systems. Its applications can be seen in a wide range of physical systems, making it an essential concept in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.

It is important to note that the superposition principle is an approximation of the true physical behavior, as most physical systems are only approximately linear. However, it is still a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing these systems.



The superposition principle applies to "any" linear system, including those involving vectors or vector fields. In these cases, the superposition principle can be extended to the concept of superposition in wave dynamics. This concept is particularly relevant in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.



#### 3.5b Superposition in Wave Dynamics



In wave dynamics, the superposition principle states that the total response of a system to multiple waves is equal to the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each individual wave. This is similar to the superposition principle in linear systems, but it applies specifically to waves and their interactions.



To understand this concept, let us consider a general solution to the homogeneous wave equation in the Cartesian coordinate system. This solution can be formed as a weighted superposition of all possible elementary plane wave solutions, with each plane wave component having a specific wave vector. The weight factor or amplitude of each plane wave component is determined by the wave vector, and the total response of the system is the sum of the responses of each individual plane wave.



This concept is particularly useful in the study of quasi-balanced circulations, as it allows us to analyze the behavior of these systems by considering the individual contributions of different waves. By understanding how these waves interact and superpose, we can gain insight into the overall behavior of the circulation.



In summary, the superposition principle is a powerful tool in the study of linear systems and wave dynamics. It allows us to break down complex systems into simpler components and analyze their behavior, providing valuable insights into the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.

The superposition principle states that the net response of a system to multiple stimuli is equal to the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually. In other words, the total effect of multiple inputs on a system is equal to the sum of the individual effects of each input.



#### 3.5a Definition of Superposition Principle



The superposition principle can be mathematically expressed as:



<math display="block">F(x_1+x_2)=F(x_1)+F(x_2) \,</math>

<math display="block">F(a x)=a F(x) \,</math>



where `a` is a scalar and `F` is a linear function. This means that the response of a linear system to a sum of inputs is equal to the sum of the individual responses to each input, and the response to a scaled input is equal to the scaled response of the original input.



The superposition principle has many applications in physics and engineering, as many physical systems can be modeled as linear systems. In the study of quasi-balanced circulations, this principle is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of ocean and atmospheric currents. For example, the superposition principle can be applied to the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which is a key component of the global ocean circulation. By understanding the individual effects of different inputs on this system, we can better predict and understand its overall behavior.



It is important to note that the superposition principle is an approximation of the true physical behavior, as most physical systems are only approximately linear. However, it is still a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing these systems. In the study of quasi-balanced circulations, the superposition principle allows us to simplify complex systems and make predictions about their behavior.



The superposition principle also applies to systems involving vectors or vector fields. In these cases, the superposition principle can be expressed as:



<math display="block">\vec{F}(\vec{x_1}+\vec{x_2})=\vec{F}(\vec{x_1})+\vec{F}(\vec{x_2}) \,</math>

<math display="block">\vec{F}(a \vec{x})=a \vec{F}(\vec{x}) \,</math>



where `\vec{F}` is a vector function and `\vec{x}` is a vector input. This allows us to apply the superposition principle to more complex systems, such as the circulation of ocean currents, which can be described as a vector field.



In summary, the superposition principle is a powerful tool in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. By understanding the individual effects of different inputs on a system, we can better predict and analyze its overall behavior. This principle allows us to simplify complex systems and make valuable predictions about their behavior.





### Section: 3.6 The secondary circulation:



The secondary circulation is a key component of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It refers to the flow of fluid that is perpendicular to the primary flow, and is often associated with boundary layers and vortices. In this section, we will define the secondary circulation and discuss its importance in understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations.



#### 3.6a Definition of Secondary Circulation



The secondary circulation can be defined as the flow of fluid that is perpendicular to the primary flow in a quasi-balanced circulation. This flow is often associated with boundary layers, which are thin layers of fluid that form at the boundaries of the primary flow. The secondary circulation is driven by pressure gradients and is responsible for mixing and transporting properties such as heat, salt, and momentum within the fluid.



In the context of ocean and atmospheric circulations, the secondary circulation is particularly important in regions where the primary flow is strong and steady. In these regions, the secondary circulation can play a significant role in redistributing properties and maintaining the quasi-balanced state of the system. For example, in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, the secondary circulation is responsible for transporting warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic, where it cools and sinks, driving the global ocean circulation.



The secondary circulation can also be observed in smaller-scale systems, such as circular flow in a bowl or cup. In this case, the secondary flow is driven by a pressure gradient from the perimeter of the bowl or cup towards the center. This secondary flow is responsible for mixing and transporting particles within the fluid, and can be seen by sprinkling heavy particles into the water and observing their movement.



Overall, the secondary circulation is a crucial component of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It plays a key role in redistributing properties and maintaining the quasi-balanced state of the system. In the next subsection, we will discuss the different types of secondary circulation and their characteristics.

The formation of secondary circulation is closely linked to the primary flow and the presence of boundary layers. As the primary flow moves along a boundary, it creates a pressure gradient that drives the secondary flow perpendicular to it. This secondary flow can take the form of vortices, eddies, or boundary currents, depending on the specific characteristics of the primary flow and the boundary.



One of the key effects of secondary circulation is the mixing and transport of properties within the fluid. This is particularly important in regions where there are strong gradients in properties, such as temperature or salinity. The secondary flow can help to homogenize these properties, leading to a more balanced and stable system.



In addition, the secondary circulation can also play a role in the maintenance of quasi-balanced circulations. In the case of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, the secondary flow helps to redistribute warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic, where it cools and sinks, driving the global ocean circulation. Without this secondary flow, the primary flow would not be able to maintain its quasi-balanced state.



Overall, the secondary circulation is a crucial component of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It helps to maintain the stability and balance of these systems, and plays a key role in the transport and mixing of properties within the fluid. Understanding the formation and effects of secondary circulation is essential for comprehending the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres.





### Section: 3.6 The secondary circulation:



The secondary circulation is a crucial aspect of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It plays a significant role in redistributing properties and maintaining the quasi-balanced state of the system. In this section, we will discuss the secondary circulation in oceanic and atmospheric circulations, and its importance in understanding the behavior of quasi-balanced systems.



#### 3.6c Secondary Circulation in Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations



The secondary circulation in oceanic and atmospheric circulations is driven by pressure gradients and is responsible for mixing and transporting properties such as heat, salt, and momentum within the fluid. It is often associated with boundary layers, which are thin layers of fluid that form at the boundaries of the primary flow. The secondary circulation is perpendicular to the primary flow and can be observed in both large-scale and small-scale systems.



In the context of oceanic circulations, the secondary circulation is particularly important in regions where the primary flow is strong and steady. One example of this is the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which is responsible for transporting warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic. The secondary circulation in the AMOC is crucial for maintaining the global ocean circulation and plays a significant role in redistributing heat and nutrients throughout the ocean.



In atmospheric circulations, the secondary circulation is also important in regions where the primary flow is strong and steady. One example of this is the Hadley cell, which is a large-scale atmospheric circulation that transports heat from the equator to the poles. The secondary circulation in the Hadley cell is responsible for redistributing heat and moisture within the atmosphere, and plays a crucial role in regulating global climate patterns.



The formation of secondary circulation is closely linked to the concept of quasigeostrophy and pseudo-potential vorticity. Quasigeostrophy refers to the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force in a rotating fluid, while pseudo-potential vorticity is a conserved quantity in quasigeostrophic flows. The secondary circulation arises due to the presence of these forces and is responsible for maintaining the quasi-balanced state of the system.



In conclusion, the secondary circulation is a key component of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It is driven by pressure gradients and plays a crucial role in redistributing properties within the fluid. Understanding the secondary circulation is essential for comprehending the behavior of quasi-balanced systems and their impact on global climate patterns.

## Chapter: Quasi-Balanced Circulations in Oceans and Atmospheres: A Comprehensive Guide



### Introduction:



In the previous chapters, we have discussed the fundamental concepts of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. We have explored the basic balance systems and their applications in understanding the dynamics of these fluid systems. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic and discuss higher-order balance systems.



Higher-order balance systems are essential in understanding the complex dynamics of oceans and atmospheres. These systems take into account the effects of non-linearities and small-scale processes that are often neglected in the basic balance systems. By incorporating these higher-order terms, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the circulation patterns and their variability.

We will also discuss the role of these balance systems in predicting weather patterns and climate variability. Additionally, we will explore the applications of these systems in oceanic and atmospheric modeling.



Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to higher-order balance systems in oceans and atmospheres. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the complexities involved in these fluid systems and how higher-order balance systems can help us gain a more accurate understanding of their dynamics. 





### Section: 4.1 Rossby waves:



Rossby waves are a type of planetary wave that plays a crucial role in the dynamics of oceans and atmospheres. These waves are named after the Swedish meteorologist Carl-Gustaf Rossby, who first described them in the 1930s. Rossby waves are characterized by their large horizontal scale and slow propagation speed, making them important in understanding the large-scale circulation patterns in oceans and atmospheres.



#### 4.1a Definition of Rossby Waves



Rossby waves can be defined as large-scale, meandering waves that propagate in the oceans and atmospheres. These waves are a result of the interaction between the Earth's rotation and the fluid motion in the oceans and atmospheres. They are typically observed in the mid-latitudes, where the Coriolis force is significant.



To understand the dynamics of Rossby waves, we must first consider the conservation of potential vorticity. In the absence of friction and other small-scale processes, potential vorticity is conserved in the oceans and atmospheres. This conservation principle is crucial in understanding the behavior of Rossby waves.



The potential vorticity equation for a frictionless, homogeneous flow can be written as:



$$

{dq \over dt}=0 \qquad \text{with} \qquad q={\zeta + f \over h},

$$



where $q$ is the potential vorticity, $\zeta$ is the relative vorticity, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $h$ is the fluid depth. This equation states that the potential vorticity remains constant as the fluid moves, and any changes in the relative vorticity must be balanced by changes in the fluid depth.



On a beta-plane and for a linearly sloping bottom in the meridional direction, the potential vorticity becomes:



$$

q = {f_0+\beta_0 y + \zeta \over H_0 + \alpha_0 y + \eta}.

$$



This equation shows the relationship between potential vorticity and the Coriolis parameter, the beta-parameter, and the topographic parameters. It also highlights the importance of these parameters in understanding the dynamics of Rossby waves.



In the context of Rossby waves, the beta-parameter plays a crucial role. It is defined as the rate of change of the Coriolis parameter with latitude and is given by:



$$

\beta_0 = {df \over dy}.

$$



The beta-parameter is responsible for the curvature of Rossby waves and is a measure of the strength of the Coriolis force. In the presence of a beta-plane, the potential vorticity equation becomes:



$$

q = {f_0 \over H_0} \left(1+{\beta_0y \over f_0} + {\zeta \over f_0} \right)\left(1-{\alpha_0y \over H_0}- {\eta \over H_0} + \ldots\right),

$$



where the Taylor expansion was used on the denominator, and the dots indicate higher-order terms. This equation shows that the potential vorticity is directly proportional to the Coriolis parameter and inversely proportional to the fluid depth. It also highlights the importance of the beta-parameter in understanding the behavior of Rossby waves.



In summary, Rossby waves are large-scale, meandering waves that propagate in the oceans and atmospheres. They are a result of the interaction between the Earth's rotation and the fluid motion and are characterized by their slow propagation speed and large horizontal scale. The conservation of potential vorticity is crucial in understanding the dynamics of Rossby waves, and the beta-parameter plays a significant role in shaping their behavior. In the next section, we will explore the analogy between topographic and planetary Rossby waves and its implications for understanding the dynamics of these waves.

$$



This equation shows the relationship between potential vorticity and the Coriolis parameter, the beta-parameter, and the topographic parameters. It also highlights the importance of these parameters in understanding the behavior of Rossby waves.



#### 4.1b Formation and Propagation of Rossby Waves



Rossby waves are formed due to the interaction between the Earth's rotation and the fluid motion in the oceans and atmospheres. This interaction leads to the generation of large-scale meandering waves that propagate in the oceans and atmospheres. The formation of Rossby waves can be understood through the quasi-geostrophic approximation, where the Rossby number (Ro) and the Rossby deformation radius (Ro<sub>T</sub>) are much smaller than 1. This approximation allows us to neglect the small-scale processes and focus on the large-scale dynamics of Rossby waves.



In the quasi-geostrophic approximation, the fluid motion can be decomposed into geostrophic and ageostrophic components. The geostrophic flow components are dominant and are given by:



$$

\bar{u}=-{g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial y} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \bar{v}={g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x},

$$



where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $f_0$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $\eta$ is the sea surface height. The ageostrophic flow components, $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$, are much smaller than the geostrophic components and can be neglected in the quasi-geostrophic approximation.



Substituting these expressions for $u$ and $v$ in the equations of motion, we obtain the quasi-geostrophic equations for Rossby waves:



$$

&-{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial t}-f_0\tilde{v} = 0\\[3pt]

&{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial t}+f_0\tilde{u} = 0\\[3pt]

&{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0.

$$



Neglecting terms where small component terms ($\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}, {\partial\over\partial t}$, and $\alpha_0$) are multiplied, the expressions obtained are:



$$

&\tilde{v} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}\\[3pt]

&\tilde{u} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}\\[3pt]

&{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0.

$$



Substituting the components of the ageostrophic velocity in the continuity equation, we obtain the following result:



$$

{\partial \eta \over\partial t}-R^2{\partial\over\partial t}\nabla^2 \eta + \alpha_0\tilde{v}=0,

$$



where $R$ is the Rossby number. This equation shows that the ageostrophic flow components play a crucial role in the formation and propagation of Rossby waves.



In summary, Rossby waves are large-scale, meandering waves that propagate in the oceans and atmospheres. They are formed due to the interaction between the Earth's rotation and the fluid motion, and their dynamics can be understood through the quasi-geostrophic approximation. The ageostrophic flow components play a significant role in the formation and propagation of Rossby waves, and their behavior is governed by the conservation of potential vorticity.

#### 4.1c Rossby Waves in Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations



Rossby waves are a fundamental component of oceanic and atmospheric circulations. They are large-scale, meandering waves that propagate in the oceans and atmospheres, and are a result of the interaction between the Earth's rotation and the fluid motion. These waves are typically observed in the mid-latitudes, where the Coriolis force is significant.



##### 4.1c.1 Definition of Rossby Waves

$$



where $q$ is the potential vorticity, $\zeta$ is the relative vorticity, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $h$ is the fluid depth. This equation shows the relationship between potential vorticity and the Coriolis parameter, and highlights the importance of this parameter in understanding Rossby waves.



##### 4.1c.2 Topographic Rossby Waves



Topographic Rossby waves are a type of Rossby wave that is influenced by the Earth's topography. These waves are important in understanding the dynamics of oceanic and atmospheric circulations, as they can be affected by changes in the topography of the ocean floor or the Earth's surface.



The quasi-geostrophic approximation is often used to study topographic Rossby waves. This approximation assumes that the Rossby number, Ro, and the topographic Rossby number, Ro<sub>T</sub>, are both small (Ro, Ro<sub>T</sub> <math>\ll</math> 1). This allows for simplification of the equations, resulting in the following expressions:



$$

\tilde{v} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}\\[3pt]

\tilde{u} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}\\[3pt]

{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0.

$$



These equations show the relationship between the ageostrophic flow components, <math>\tilde{u}</math> and <math>\tilde{v}</math>, and the topography of the ocean floor or Earth's surface. They also highlight the importance of the topographic parameters, <math>H_0</math> and <math>\alpha_0</math>, in understanding topographic Rossby waves.



##### 4.1c.3 Rossby Waves in Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations



Rossby waves play a crucial role in the dynamics of oceanic and atmospheric circulations. They are responsible for the large-scale meandering patterns observed in these systems, and can have significant impacts on weather patterns and ocean currents.



In the ocean, Rossby waves are important in driving the large-scale circulation patterns, such as the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current. These waves can also affect the transport of heat and nutrients, and can influence the formation of ocean eddies.



In the atmosphere, Rossby waves are responsible for the formation of weather patterns, such as high and low-pressure systems, and can also influence the movement of storms and hurricanes. They are also important in the transport of heat and moisture, and can have significant impacts on global climate patterns.



Overall, understanding Rossby waves is crucial in understanding the dynamics of oceanic and atmospheric circulations, and their role in shaping our planet's climate and weather patterns. 





### Section: 4.2 Quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves:



Quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves are a type of Rossby wave that is characterized by their quasi-geostrophic approximation. This approximation is made when the Rossby number, Ro, and the Rossby deformation radius, Ro<sub>T</sub>, are both much smaller than 1. This approximation simplifies the equations of motion and allows for a better understanding of the dynamics of these waves.



#### 4.2a Definition of Quasi-Geostrophic Rossby Waves



Quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves can be defined as large-scale, meandering waves that propagate in the oceans and atmospheres, and are characterized by their quasi-geostrophic approximation. This approximation is made by assuming that the ageostrophic flow components, <math>\tilde{u}</math> and <math>\tilde{v}</math>, are much smaller than the geostrophic flow components, <math>\bar{u}</math> and <math>\bar{v}</math>. This allows for the equations of motion to be simplified, resulting in a better understanding of the behavior of these waves.



The quasi-geostrophic approximation is made by substituting the expressions for <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> in the previously acquired set of equations, which yields:



&-{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial t}-f_0\tilde{v} = 0\\[3pt]

&{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial t}+f_0\tilde{u} = 0\\[3pt]

&{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}+ \alpha_0\tilde{v}=0.

\end{align}</math>



Neglecting terms where small component terms (<math>\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}, {\partial\over\partial t}</math> and <math>\alpha_0</math>) are multiplied, the expressions obtained are:



&\tilde{v} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}\\[3pt]

\end{align}</math>



Substituting the components of the ageostrophic velocity in the continuity equation, the following result is obtained:



<math>{\partial \eta \over\partial t}-R^2{\partial\over\partial t}\nabla^2 \eta + \alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0,</math>



where <math>R</math> is the Rossby number. This equation shows the relationship between the Rossby number and the quasi-geostrophic approximation, highlighting the importance of this parameter in understanding quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves.



Quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves are important in understanding the dynamics of oceans and atmospheres, as they play a crucial role in the large-scale circulation patterns. They are also important in studying the effects of topography on these waves, as topographic Rossby waves are a type of quasi-geostrophic Rossby wave. In the next section, we will discuss the characteristics and behavior of topographic Rossby waves in more detail.





### Section: 4.2 Quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves:



Quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves are a type of Rossby wave that is characterized by their quasi-geostrophic approximation. This approximation is made when the Rossby number, Ro, and the Rossby deformation radius, Ro<sub>T</sub>, are both much smaller than 1. This approximation simplifies the equations of motion and allows for a better understanding of the dynamics of these waves.



#### 4.2b Formation and Propagation of Quasi-Geostrophic Rossby Waves



Quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves are formed due to the interaction between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. In the ocean, these waves are often generated by wind stress, while in the atmosphere, they are generated by temperature gradients. These waves can also be formed by topographic features such as seamounts or continental shelves.



Once formed, quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves propagate in a westward direction in the Northern Hemisphere and eastward in the Southern Hemisphere. This is due to the Coriolis force, which deflects the waves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The speed of propagation is dependent on the Rossby deformation radius, which is a measure of the strength of the Coriolis force compared to the pressure gradient force.



The propagation of quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves is also affected by the Earth's rotation. As the waves move towards higher latitudes, the Coriolis force increases, causing the waves to become more tightly packed. This results in a decrease in the wavelength and an increase in the wave amplitude. Eventually, the waves may break, releasing energy and causing mixing in the ocean or turbulence in the atmosphere.



In addition to their westward or eastward propagation, quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves can also exhibit a north-south movement known as meridional propagation. This is caused by changes in the wind or temperature patterns, which can alter the direction of the pressure gradient force and cause the waves to move in a meridional direction.



Overall, the formation and propagation of quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves play a crucial role in the circulation of oceans and atmospheres. These waves can transport heat, momentum, and other properties, influencing weather patterns and ocean currents. Understanding the dynamics of these waves is essential for predicting and understanding the behavior of our planet's climate systems.

This approximation simplifies the equations of motion and allows for a better understanding of the dynamics of these waves.



#### 4.2c Quasi-Geostrophic Rossby Waves in Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations



Quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves play a crucial role in the circulation patterns of both oceans and atmospheres. These waves are formed due to the interaction between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, and their propagation is influenced by the Earth's rotation and the Rossby deformation radius.



In the ocean, quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves are often generated by wind stress, which creates variations in sea surface height. These waves can also be formed by topographic features such as seamounts or continental shelves. Once formed, they propagate in a westward direction in the Northern Hemisphere and eastward in the Southern Hemisphere. This westward or eastward propagation is due to the Coriolis force, which deflects the waves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.



In the atmosphere, quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves are generated by temperature gradients. These waves can also be influenced by topographic features, such as mountain ranges, which can act as barriers to the flow of air. Similar to oceanic Rossby waves, atmospheric Rossby waves also propagate in a westward direction in the Northern Hemisphere and eastward in the Southern Hemisphere.



The speed of propagation of quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves is dependent on the Rossby deformation radius, which is a measure of the strength of the Coriolis force compared to the pressure gradient force. As the waves move towards higher latitudes, the Coriolis force increases, causing the waves to become more tightly packed. This results in a decrease in the wavelength and an increase in the wave amplitude.

In addition to their westward or eastward propagation, quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves can also exhibit a north-south movement known as meridional propagation. This is caused by changes in the wind or temperature patterns, which can alter the direction of the pressure gradient force. This meridional propagation can have significant impacts on weather patterns and ocean currents, making it an important aspect to consider in the study of quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves.



Overall, understanding the dynamics of quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves is crucial in comprehending the circulation patterns of oceans and atmospheres. These waves play a significant role in shaping our planet's climate and weather patterns, making them a topic of great interest in the field of geophysical fluid dynamics. 





### Section: 4.3 Barotropic instability:



Barotropic instability is a type of instability that can occur in a barotropic fluid, where the density is a function of only pressure and not temperature. This type of instability can form in various ways, such as through interactions between the fluid flow and the bathymetry or topography of the domain, or through frontal instabilities. These instabilities are not dependent on density and can occur even when the density of the fluid is constant.



One way that barotropic instability can occur is through the presence of a shear in the velocity field. This shear induces both vertical and horizontal vorticity within the flow, leading to upwelling on one side and downwelling on the other. This situation can result in a barotropic unstable flow, with eddies forming on alternating sides of the flow. This type of instability is often observed in oceanic and atmospheric circulations, and can play a significant role in shaping these systems.



Another way that barotropic instability can occur is through the displacement of Rossby waves in the horizontal direction. This displacement leads to a transfer of kinetic energy from the mean flow to small perturbations, such as eddies. The Rayleigh-Kuo criterion states that the gradient of absolute vorticity should change sign within the domain, and this can be seen in the center of the eddies where the acceleration of the flow perpendicular to the flow changes direction.



In oceanic circulations, barotropic instability can be generated by wind stress, which creates variations in sea surface height. These waves can also be formed by topographic features such as seamounts or continental shelves. In the atmosphere, barotropic instability can be generated by temperature gradients and can also be influenced by topographic features, such as mountain ranges.



The speed of propagation of barotropic instability is dependent on the Rossby deformation radius, which is a measure of the strength of the Coriolis force compared to the pressure gradient force. As the waves move towards higher latitudes, the Coriolis force becomes stronger, and the Rossby deformation radius decreases, leading to a decrease in the speed of propagation.

In summary, barotropic instability is a type of instability that can occur in a barotropic fluid, and it plays a significant role in shaping oceanic and atmospheric circulations. It can be caused by various factors, such as shear in the velocity field or displacement of Rossby waves, and its speed of propagation is dependent on the Rossby deformation radius. 





### Section: 4.3 Barotropic instability:



Barotropic instability is a type of instability that can occur in a barotropic fluid, where the density is a function of only pressure and not temperature. This type of instability can form in various ways, such as through interactions between the fluid flow and the bathymetry or topography of the domain, or through frontal instabilities. These instabilities are not dependent on density and can occur even when the density of the fluid is constant.



One way that barotropic instability can occur is through the presence of a shear in the velocity field. This shear induces both vertical and horizontal vorticity within the flow, leading to upwelling on one side and downwelling on the other. This situation can result in a barotropic unstable flow, with eddies forming on alternating sides of the flow. This type of instability is often observed in oceanic and atmospheric circulations, and can play a significant role in shaping these systems.



Another way that barotropic instability can occur is through the displacement of Rossby waves in the horizontal direction. This displacement leads to a transfer of kinetic energy from the mean flow to small perturbations, such as eddies. The Rayleigh-Kuo criterion states that the gradient of absolute vorticity should change sign within the domain, and this can be seen in the center of the eddies where the acceleration of the flow perpendicular to the flow changes direction.



In oceanic circulations, barotropic instability can be generated by wind stress, which creates variations in sea surface height. These waves can also be formed by topographic features such as seamounts or continental shelves. In the atmosphere, barotropic instability can be generated by temperature gradients and can also be influenced by topographic features, such as mountain ranges.



The speed of propagation of barotropic instability is dependent on the Rossby deformation radius, which is a measure of the strength of the Coriolis force compared to the restoring force of the fluid. This radius is defined as the ratio of the fluid's vertical scale to its horizontal scale. When the Rossby deformation radius is small, the fluid is more susceptible to barotropic instability.



### Subsection: 4.3b Causes and Effects of Barotropic Instability



The causes of barotropic instability can vary depending on the specific system being studied. In general, any factor that introduces a shear in the velocity field or a displacement of Rossby waves can lead to barotropic instability. This can include wind stress, topographic features, and temperature gradients.



The effects of barotropic instability can also vary, but in general, it leads to the formation of eddies and other small-scale features in the flow. These eddies can play a significant role in the transport of heat, momentum, and other properties within the fluid. They can also impact larger-scale circulations and contribute to the overall dynamics of the system.



One notable effect of barotropic instability is the transfer of kinetic energy from the mean flow to small-scale eddies. This can result in a decrease in the mean flow's energy and a corresponding increase in the eddy energy. This energy transfer can have significant implications for the overall circulation and can even lead to changes in the system's stability.



Another effect of barotropic instability is the mixing of different water masses in the ocean or different air masses in the atmosphere. As eddies form and interact with each other, they can mix different properties, such as temperature and salinity in the ocean or temperature and moisture in the atmosphere. This mixing can have important consequences for the distribution of heat and other properties within the fluid.



In summary, barotropic instability is a common phenomenon in oceans and atmospheres, and it plays a crucial role in shaping these systems. It can be caused by various factors and can lead to the formation of eddies and other small-scale features. The effects of barotropic instability can have significant implications for the overall dynamics and stability of the system, making it an essential concept to understand in the study of quasi-balanced circulations.

These waves can also be formed by topographic features such as seamounts or continental shelves.

The speed of propagation of barotropic instability is dependent on the Rossby deformation radius, which is a measure of the strength of the Coriolis force relative to the fluid's inertia. This radius is defined as the ratio of the fluid's velocity to the Coriolis parameter, and it characterizes the scale at which the flow becomes unstable. When the Rossby deformation radius is small, the flow is more susceptible to barotropic instability, as the Coriolis force is weaker relative to the fluid's inertia.



In oceanic and atmospheric circulations, barotropic instability can have significant impacts on the overall circulation patterns. In the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), for example, barotropic instability can lead to the formation of eddies that can transport heat and nutrients throughout the ocean. These eddies can also play a role in the mixing of different water masses, which can have implications for the global climate.



In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of barotropic instability in the Earth's oceans and atmosphere. With the availability of new observational data and advancements in numerical modeling, scientists have been able to better characterize and simulate these instabilities. However, there is still much to be learned about the complex interactions between barotropic instability and other processes in the Earth's fluid systems.



#### 4.3c Barotropic Instability in Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations



Barotropic instability is a common phenomenon in both oceanic and atmospheric circulations. In the ocean, it can occur in the form of eddies and meanders in the Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio Current, and other major ocean currents. These eddies can have a significant impact on the transport of heat and nutrients, as well as the mixing of different water masses. In the atmosphere, barotropic instability can lead to the formation of storms and other weather systems.



One of the key factors that can influence barotropic instability in both oceanic and atmospheric circulations is the presence of topographic features. These features can act as barriers or obstacles to the flow, causing changes in the velocity and vorticity fields. In the ocean, seamounts, ridges, and continental shelves can all play a role in the formation and propagation of barotropic instabilities. In the atmosphere, mountain ranges and other landforms can have a similar effect.



Another important factor to consider is the role of external forcing, such as wind stress or temperature gradients. These external forces can drive the formation of barotropic instabilities, and their strength and direction can have a significant impact on the resulting flow patterns. In the ocean, wind stress can create variations in sea surface height, leading to the formation of eddies. In the atmosphere, temperature gradients can drive the formation of storms and other weather systems.



Understanding barotropic instability is crucial for predicting and understanding the behavior of oceanic and atmospheric circulations. It can also have important implications for climate change, as changes in these instabilities can affect the transport of heat and nutrients, as well as the mixing of different water masses. Further research and advancements in modeling techniques will continue to improve our understanding of barotropic instability and its role in Earth's fluid systems.





### Section: 4.4 The Charney-Stern theorem:



The Charney-Stern theorem is a fundamental result in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of these systems and has important implications for predicting their behavior.



#### 4.4a Statement of the Charney-Stern Theorem



The Charney-Stern theorem states that in a quasi-balanced circulation, the potential vorticity (PV) is conserved along fluid particle trajectories. This means that the PV at any given point in the flow remains constant as the fluid particles move along their paths. This is a powerful result, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations without having to explicitly solve for the fluid motion.



To understand the significance of this theorem, we must first define what is meant by a quasi-balanced circulation. A quasi-balanced circulation is a flow in which the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are approximately in balance. This balance is achieved when the Rossby number, which is a measure of the ratio of the inertial forces to the Coriolis force, is small. In other words, the flow is slow enough that the Coriolis force dominates over the other forces.



The Charney-Stern theorem is a consequence of the quasi-balanced nature of these circulations. It can be derived from the equations of motion for a rotating, stratified fluid, known as the primitive equations. These equations describe the conservation of mass, momentum, and potential temperature in a fluid. By combining these equations with the conservation of PV, we can derive the Charney-Stern theorem.



The implications of this theorem are far-reaching. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations without having to explicitly solve for the fluid motion. This is particularly useful in the study of large-scale oceanic and atmospheric circulations, where the equations of motion can be very complex and difficult to solve. By using the Charney-Stern theorem, we can simplify our analysis and gain a deeper understanding of these systems.



In summary, the Charney-Stern theorem is a fundamental result in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. It states that the potential vorticity is conserved along fluid particle trajectories in these systems, and has important implications for predicting their behavior. This theorem is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of these complex systems and is essential for anyone studying oceanography or atmospheric science.

#### 4.4b Proof and Implications of the Charney-Stern Theorem



The proof of the Charney-Stern theorem relies on the Cameron-Martin theorem, which states that in a quasi-balanced circulation, the PV is conserved along fluid particle trajectories. This theorem is a powerful tool in the study of quasi-balanced circulations, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of these systems without having to explicitly solve for the fluid motion.



To prove the Charney-Stern theorem, we first define the weight of an edge <math>xy\in E(G)</math> as <math>\it{w}_{xy}</math>. We also define the weight of a vertex <math>x</math> as <math>\it{w}_x=\sum_{y:xy\in E(G)}\it{w}_{xy}.</math> Using these definitions, we can then derive three lemmas that are crucial to the proof of the Charney-Stern theorem.



The first lemma states that the weight of a vertex is conserved along fluid particle trajectories. This means that as the fluid particles move along their paths, the weight of the vertex they pass through remains constant. This is a key result, as it allows us to establish a connection between the weight of a vertex and the PV at that point.



The second lemma states that the weight of a vertex is proportional to the PV at that point. This is a crucial step in the proof, as it allows us to establish a direct relationship between the weight of a vertex and the PV at that point. This relationship is then used to derive the Charney-Stern theorem.



Finally, the third lemma states that the PV is conserved along fluid particle trajectories. This is the key result that allows us to prove the Charney-Stern theorem. By combining this lemma with the previous two, we can establish that the PV is conserved along fluid particle trajectories in a quasi-balanced circulation.



The implications of the Charney-Stern theorem are far-reaching. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of quasi-balanced circulations without having to explicitly solve for the fluid motion.

This allows us to make predictions about the behavior of these systems, such as changes in the strength of the circulation or the formation of multiple equilibria, without having to solve for the complex fluid dynamics involved.



#### 4.4c Applications of the Charney-Stern Theorem in Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations



The Charney-Stern theorem has been applied in various studies of oceanic and atmospheric circulations. One notable application is in the study of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which plays a crucial role in the global climate system. The theorem has been used to understand the behavior of the AMOC and its response to changes in external forcing, such as changes in freshwater fluxes or salinity fluxes.



For example, the Stommel box model, which was first devised in 1961, has been used to study the changes in AMOC caused by changes in freshwater or salinity fluxes. This simple model is based on the assumption that the strength of the AMOC is linearly proportional to the equator-pole density difference, and it has been shown to produce stable responses to constant forcing. The Charney-Stern theorem has been used to understand the behavior of this model and to make predictions about the response of the AMOC to different forcing scenarios.



In addition, the Charney-Stern theorem has also been used to study the MOC Observations, which have provided valuable insights into the behavior of the AMOC. For example, Kanzow and colleagues (2007) demonstrated the effectiveness of the MOC Observations and reported a small variability in the sum of transports into the North Atlantic, indicating a stable response to external forcing. Cunningham et al. (2007) also utilized MOC Observations and reported a year-long average MOC with a large variability, highlighting the importance of understanding the behavior of the AMOC.



Furthermore, Johns et al. (2009) used the Charney-Stern theorem to study the meridional heat transport in the AMOC. They found that the AMOC accounted for nearly 90% of the total heat transport, with the remainder contained in a quasi-stationary gyre pattern. This highlights the importance of the AMOC in the global heat transport and the potential implications of changes in the AMOC on global climate.



In conclusion, the Charney-Stern theorem has been a valuable tool in the study of quasi-balanced circulations in oceans and atmospheres. Its applications in understanding the behavior of the AMOC and other circulations have provided valuable insights and have helped us make predictions about the response of these systems to external forcing. As our understanding of these circulations continues to evolve, the Charney-Stern theorem will undoubtedly play a crucial role in furthering our knowledge of these complex systems.
