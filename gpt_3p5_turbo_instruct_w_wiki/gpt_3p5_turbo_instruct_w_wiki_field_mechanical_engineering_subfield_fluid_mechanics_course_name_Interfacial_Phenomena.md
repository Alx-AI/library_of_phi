## Chapter: Interfacial Phenomena: A Comprehensive Guide



### Introduction:



Interfacial phenomena are the physical and chemical processes that occur at the interface between two different phases of matter. These phases can include solid-liquid, liquid-liquid, liquid-gas, or solid-gas interfaces. The study of interfacial phenomena is crucial in understanding various natural and industrial processes, such as the behavior of surfactants in cleaning products, the formation of bubbles and droplets, and the stability of emulsions and foams.



In this chapter, we will focus on one of the fundamental properties of interfacial phenomena - surface tension. Surface tension is defined as the force per unit length acting on the surface of a liquid, and it is responsible for the behavior of liquids at interfaces. Understanding the definition and scaling of surface tension is essential in comprehending the behavior of liquids at interfaces and their interactions with other phases of matter.



We will begin by discussing the definition of surface tension and how it is related to other interfacial properties, such as interfacial energy and contact angle. We will then explore the various factors that influence surface tension, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of surfactants. Finally, we will delve into the scaling of surface tension and how it relates to the size and shape of interfaces.



By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of surface tension and its role in interfacial phenomena. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for further exploration of interfacial processes and their applications in various fields, including chemistry, physics, and engineering. 





## Chapter 2: Definition and Scaling of Surface Tension:



### Section: 2.1 Wetting:



Wetting is the process by which a liquid spreads over a solid surface. This phenomenon is governed by the balance between the cohesive forces within the liquid and the adhesive forces between the liquid and the solid surface. The degree of wetting is determined by the contact angle, which is the angle formed between the liquid-solid interface and the tangent to the liquid surface at the point of contact.



#### Subsection: 2.1a Introduction to Wetting



Wetting plays a crucial role in many natural and industrial processes, such as coating, adhesion, and lubrication. It is also a key factor in the behavior of surfactants, which are molecules that can lower the surface tension of a liquid and affect its wetting properties.



The wetting behavior of a liquid on a solid surface can be classified into three categories: wetting, non-wetting, and partial wetting. In wetting, the liquid spreads completely over the surface, resulting in a contact angle of 0 degrees. In non-wetting, the liquid forms a droplet on the surface, resulting in a contact angle of 180 degrees. Partial wetting occurs when the contact angle is between 0 and 180 degrees.



The degree of wetting is also influenced by the surface energy of the solid surface. A surface with a higher surface energy will have a lower contact angle and exhibit better wetting behavior. This is because the adhesive forces between the liquid and the solid surface are stronger, leading to a larger spreading of the liquid.



The wetting behavior of a liquid can also be affected by the presence of impurities or contaminants on the solid surface. These impurities can alter the surface energy and change the wetting properties of the surface.



In the next section, we will explore the various factors that influence surface tension, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of surfactants.

Wetting is a fundamental interfacial phenomenon that occurs when a liquid comes into contact with a solid surface. It is a complex process that is governed by the balance between cohesive forces within the liquid and adhesive forces between the liquid and the solid surface. In this section, we will explore the different aspects of wetting, including its definition, types, and factors that influence it.



#### Subsection: 2.1a Introduction to Wetting



Wetting is a ubiquitous phenomenon that plays a crucial role in many natural and industrial processes. It is involved in processes such as coating, adhesion, and lubrication, and is also a key factor in the behavior of surfactants. Surfactants are molecules that can lower the surface tension of a liquid and affect its wetting properties.



The degree of wetting is determined by the contact angle, which is the angle formed between the liquid-solid interface and the tangent to the liquid surface at the point of contact. This angle is influenced by various factors, including the surface energy of the solid surface, the presence of impurities, and the properties of the liquid itself.



There are three main categories of wetting behavior: wetting, non-wetting, and partial wetting. In wetting, the liquid spreads completely over the surface, resulting in a contact angle of 0 degrees. In non-wetting, the liquid forms a droplet on the surface, resulting in a contact angle of 180 degrees. Partial wetting occurs when the contact angle is between 0 and 180 degrees.

The presence of impurities or contaminants on the solid surface can also affect the wetting behavior of a liquid. These impurities can alter the surface energy and change the wetting properties of the surface. This is particularly important in industrial processes, where the cleanliness of the solid surface is crucial for achieving desired wetting behavior.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the factors that influence surface tension, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of surfactants. We will also explore the different types of wetting and their applications in various fields.

#### Subsection: 2.1b Factors Affecting Wetting



As mentioned earlier, the surface energy of the solid surface is a key factor in determining the degree of wetting. However, there are other factors that can also influence wetting behavior. These include the surface roughness of the solid surface, the viscosity of the liquid, and the presence of impurities on the surface.



Surface roughness can affect wetting behavior by providing more surface area for the liquid to interact with. A rougher surface can lead to a higher contact angle and reduced wetting. On the other hand, a smoother surface can promote wetting by reducing the contact angle.



The viscosity of the liquid also plays a role in wetting behavior. A more viscous liquid will have a higher resistance to flow and may not spread as easily on a solid surface. This can result in a higher contact angle and reduced wetting.



Impurities on the solid surface can also affect wetting behavior. These impurities can alter the surface energy of the solid surface and lead to changes in the contact angle. Additionally, they can act as barriers to wetting, preventing the liquid from spreading evenly on the surface.



#### Subsection: 2.1c Wetting Applications



The understanding and control of wetting behavior have numerous applications in various fields. One of the most well-known applications is in the design of coatings and adhesives. By understanding the factors that influence wetting, scientists and engineers can develop coatings and adhesives with specific wetting properties for different applications.



Wetting also plays a crucial role in the functioning of electrowetting devices. These devices use an electric field to manipulate the contact angle and control the movement of liquids on a solid surface. This technology has been used in applications such as adjustable lenses, electronic displays, and switches for optical fibers.



In recent years, wetting has also been studied for its potential in environmental applications. For example, electrowetting has been proposed as a method for cleaning up oil spills and separating oil-water mixtures. Additionally, the suppression of the "coffee ring effect" through wetting has been explored for its potential in manipulating soft matter.



Overall, the study of wetting has a wide range of applications and continues to be an active area of research. With advancements in technology and a deeper understanding of the underlying principles, wetting will continue to play a crucial role in various fields and industries.

### Section 3.1: Stress Boundary Conditions



In the previous chapter, we discussed the concept of surface tension and its effects on interfacial phenomena. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic by exploring Young's Law and its applications. Young's Law is a fundamental principle in interfacial science that describes the relationship between the contact angle of a liquid droplet on a solid surface and the interfacial tensions between the three phases involved. This law has numerous applications in various fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology.



### Subsection 3.1a: Definition of Stress Boundary Conditions



Before we dive into the applications of Young's Law, it is important to understand the concept of stress boundary conditions. In the study of interfacial phenomena, stress boundary conditions refer to the forces and stresses acting at the interface between two phases. These conditions play a crucial role in determining the behavior of the interface and the overall system.



In the context of Young's Law, stress boundary conditions are particularly important as they influence the contact angle of a liquid droplet on a solid surface. The contact angle is the angle formed between the tangent of the droplet's surface and the solid surface at the point of contact. It is a measure of the wetting behavior of the liquid on the solid surface.



The stress boundary conditions at the interface between the liquid, solid, and gas phases are determined by the interfacial tensions between these phases. These tensions arise due to the imbalance of cohesive forces at the interface. For example, at the liquid-gas interface, the cohesive forces between liquid molecules are greater than the adhesive forces between liquid and gas molecules, resulting in a surface tension that pulls the liquid molecules together.



In the case of a liquid droplet on a solid surface, the interfacial tensions between the liquid, solid, and gas phases determine the contact angle. According to Young's Law, the contact angle is directly proportional to the interfacial tensions between the liquid and solid phases and inversely proportional to the interfacial tension between the liquid and gas phases. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:



$$\cos\theta = \frac{\gamma_{sg} - \gamma_{sl}}{\gamma_{lg}}$$



Where $\theta$ is the contact angle, $\gamma_{sg}$ is the interfacial tension between the solid and gas phases, $\gamma_{sl}$ is the interfacial tension between the solid and liquid phases, and $\gamma_{lg}$ is the interfacial tension between the liquid and gas phases.



In the next section, we will explore the different factors that can influence the contact angle and how they relate to the stress boundary conditions at the interface.

According to Young's Law, the contact angle is directly proportional to the interfacial tensions between the liquid and solid phases, and inversely proportional to the interfacial tension between the liquid and gas phases. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:



$$\gamma_{SL} = \gamma_{SG} + \gamma_{LG} \cos\theta$$



Where:

- $\gamma_{SL}$ is the interfacial tension between the solid and liquid phases

- $\gamma_{SG}$ is the interfacial tension between the solid and gas phases

- $\gamma_{LG}$ is the interfacial tension between the liquid and gas phases

- $\theta$ is the contact angle



This equation is known as Young's Law and is a fundamental principle in interfacial science. It is often used to predict the behavior of liquid droplets on solid surfaces and has numerous applications in various fields.

The stress boundary conditions at the interface between the liquid, solid, and gas phases are determined by the interfacial tensions between these phases. These tensions arise due to the imbalance of cohesive forces at the interface. For example, at the liquid-gas interface, the cohesive forces between liquid molecules are greater than the adhesive forces between liquid and gas molecules, resulting in a surface tension that pulls the liquid molecules together.



In the case of a liquid droplet on a solid surface, the stress boundary conditions are influenced by the interfacial tensions between the liquid and solid phases, as well as the liquid-gas and solid-gas interfacial tensions. These tensions determine the shape and stability of the droplet on the solid surface.



### Subsection 3.1b: Young's Law and Contact Angle



Young's Law states that the contact angle of a liquid droplet on a solid surface is determined by the interfacial tensions between the three phases involved. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:



$$\gamma_{SL} = \gamma_{SG} + \gamma_{LG} \cos\theta$$



where $\gamma_{SL}$ is the interfacial tension between the solid and liquid phases, $\gamma_{SG}$ is the interfacial tension between the solid and gas phases, $\gamma_{LG}$ is the interfacial tension between the liquid and gas phases, and $\theta$ is the contact angle.



This equation shows that the contact angle is directly proportional to the difference in interfacial tensions between the solid-liquid and solid-gas interfaces. A larger difference in tensions results in a larger contact angle, indicating a less wetting behavior of the liquid on the solid surface.



### Subsection 3.1c: Challenges in Stress Boundary Conditions



While Young's Law provides a fundamental understanding of the relationship between interfacial tensions and contact angle, there are challenges in accurately determining stress boundary conditions in real-world systems. One of the main challenges is the limitation of the C<sub>μ</sub> coefficient in the explicit algebraic stress model (EASM).



The EASM is a widely used model for predicting stress boundary conditions in interfacial systems. However, the C<sub>μ</sub> coefficient, which is a constant in the model, can become singular in certain cases, leading to inaccurate predictions. To address this issue, various approaches have been proposed, such as introducing a regularization term or using a quasi self-consistent approach.



Another challenge is the complexity of determining stress boundary conditions in three-dimensional systems. In these cases, the equations for determining the stress boundary conditions become higher order and may not have closed-form solutions. This makes it difficult to accurately predict the behavior of the interface in three-dimensional systems.



Despite these challenges, the study of stress boundary conditions and their influence on interfacial phenomena is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of interfacial systems. Young's Law and other fundamental principles provide a solid foundation for further research and applications in this field.

## Chapter 4: More on Fluid Statics



### Section 4.1: Spinning, Tumbling, and Rolling Drops



In the previous chapter, we discussed the fundamentals of fluid statics, including the concept of pressure, hydrostatic equilibrium, and the behavior of fluids in containers. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of fluid statics and explore more advanced concepts and applications.



In this section, we will focus on the behavior of drops in a fluid. Drops are a common occurrence in nature and can be found in various forms, such as raindrops, dewdrops, and even in the form of bubbles. Drops are also important in many industrial processes, such as in the production of emulsions and foams.



#### 4.1a: Introduction to Fluid Motion



Before we dive into the behavior of drops, it is essential to understand the basics of fluid motion. Fluid motion is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in a fluid. These equations can be simplified for the case of incompressible, inviscid flow, which is often used to model the behavior of drops.



One of the key parameters in fluid motion is the Reynolds number, which is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in a fluid. For low Reynolds numbers, viscous forces dominate, and the fluid motion is smooth and laminar. On the other hand, for high Reynolds numbers, inertial forces dominate, and the fluid motion becomes turbulent.



Now, let's turn our attention to the behavior of drops in a fluid. Drops can exhibit various types of motion, such as spinning, tumbling, and rolling. These motions are a result of the interplay between surface tension, gravity, and fluid flow.



When a drop is placed in a fluid, it experiences a downward force due to gravity and an upward force due to surface tension. If the drop is initially at rest, these forces will balance each other, and the drop will remain stationary. However, if the drop is given a slight disturbance, it can start to spin around its axis. This spinning motion is a result of the surface tension forces acting tangentially to the surface of the drop.



As the drop spins, it also experiences a torque due to the difference in pressure between the front and back of the drop. This torque causes the drop to tumble, or rotate around a different axis. The combination of spinning and tumbling results in a complex motion known as "chaotic advection," which is characterized by the mixing of fluid particles within the drop.



In some cases, drops can also exhibit rolling motion, where the drop moves in a straight line while rotating around its axis. This motion is a result of the interaction between the drop and the surrounding fluid flow. As the drop moves, it creates a wake behind it, which can cause the drop to roll in the direction of the flow.



In conclusion, the behavior of drops in a fluid is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by various factors, such as surface tension, gravity, and fluid flow. Understanding the motion of drops is crucial in many applications, such as in the production of emulsions and foams, and can also provide insights into the behavior of fluids in nature.

If the drop is initially at rest, these forces will balance each other, and the drop will remain stationary. However, if the drop is given an initial velocity, it will start to move and exhibit different types of motion depending on the initial conditions.



#### 4.1b: Fluid Dynamics



To understand the behavior of drops in a fluid, we must first understand the equations that govern fluid motion. The Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in a fluid, can be simplified for the case of incompressible, inviscid flow. This simplification is often used to model the behavior of drops in a fluid.

Another important factor in the behavior of drops is the surface tension of the fluid. Surface tension is the force that causes the surface of a liquid to contract and is responsible for the spherical shape of drops. When a drop is placed in a fluid, it experiences an upward force due to surface tension, which balances the downward force of gravity.



The interplay between surface tension, gravity, and fluid flow results in the different types of motion exhibited by drops in a fluid. Spinning, tumbling, and rolling drops are all examples of this interplay, and understanding the underlying fluid dynamics is crucial in studying these phenomena.



In conclusion, drops in a fluid exhibit various types of motion, which are a result of the interplay between surface tension, gravity, and fluid flow. The Navier-Stokes equations and the Reynolds number play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of drops, and further research in this area can lead to advancements in various fields, such as industrial processes and atmospheric science.

## Chapter 5: Capillary Rise:



### Section: 5.1 Marangoni Flows:



Capillary rise is a phenomenon that occurs at the interface between two different phases, such as a solid-liquid or liquid-liquid interface. It is a result of the interplay between surface tension, gravity, and the properties of the liquid and solid involved. In this section, we will discuss a specific type of capillary rise known as Marangoni flows.



#### Subsection: 5.1a Introduction to Marangoni Flows



Marangoni flows are driven by surface tension gradients, which arise due to variations in surface tension along the interface. These variations can be caused by differences in temperature, concentration, or surface composition. The resulting flow is known as a Marangoni flow, named after the Italian physicist Carlo Marangoni who first observed it in 1865.



The general equation for heat transfer, also known as the Fourier's law, plays a crucial role in understanding Marangoni flows. It describes the transfer of heat through a material due to a temperature gradient. In the case of Marangoni flows, this equation is modified to include the effects of surface tension gradients. This leads to the equation for entropy production, which takes into account the changes in temperature, pressure, and velocity at the interface.



$$

\rho d\varepsilon = \rho Tds + {p\over{\rho}}d\rho \\

\rho dh = \rho Tds + dp

$$



The Marangoni effect can also be described using the Young-Laplace equation, which relates the surface tension, contact angle, and curvature at the interface. This equation is essential in understanding the behavior of fluids in confined spaces, such as capillary tubes, where the curvature of the interface plays a significant role.



$$

v_{i} {\partial \sigma_{ij}\over{\partial x_{j}}} = {\partial\over{\partial x_{j}}}\left(\sigma_{ij}v_{i} \right ) - \sigma_{ij}{\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}} \\

\rho {\partial k\over{\partial t}} = -\rho {\bf v}\cdot\nabla k - \rho {\bf v}\cdot\nabla h + \rho T{\bf v}\cdot \nabla s + \nabla\cdot(\sigma\cdot {\bf v}) - \sigma_{ij}{\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}} \\

\rho {\partial\varepsilon\over{\partial t}} = \rho T {\partial s\over{\partial t}} - {p\over{\rho}}\nabla\cdot(\rho {\bf v}) \\

\sigma_{ij}{\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}} = \mu\left( {\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}} + {\partial v_{j}\over{\partial x_{i}}} - {2\over{3}}\delta_{ij}\nabla\cdot {\bf v} \right){\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}} + \zeta \delta_{ij}{\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}}\nabla\cdot {\bf v}

$$



In the absence of thermal conduction and viscous forces, the equation for entropy production collapses to $Ds/Dt=0$, indicating that ideal fluid flow is isentropic.



### Application



The Marangoni effect has numerous applications in various fields. In biology, it plays a crucial role in the movement of fluids in plants and the functioning of the human circulatory system. In engineering, it is essential in the design of microfluidic devices and the transport of fluids in porous materials. The Marangoni effect is also used in the measurement and control of capillary rise, such as the use of surfactants and surface modifications.



This equation was first derived in Section 49 of the sixth volume of L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz's "Course of Theoretical Physics", which discusses "Thermal Conduction in Fluids". It has been used to measure the heat transfer and air flow in a domestic refrigerator, to do a harmonic analysis of regenerators, and to understand the physics of glaciers.



In conclusion, Marangoni flows are an essential aspect of capillary rise and have numerous applications in various fields. Further research in this area is ongoing, and it is an exciting area of study for understanding interfacial phenomena.

$$



The Marangoni effect has significant applications in various fields, including fluid dynamics, materials science, and engineering. In fluid dynamics, it is used to study the behavior of fluids in microfluidic devices, where surface tension plays a crucial role. In materials science, it is used to understand the formation of patterns and structures on the surface of materials. In engineering, it is used to design and optimize processes involving liquid-liquid or solid-liquid interfaces, such as in the production of emulsions or coatings.



## Application



This equation is derived in Section 49, at the opening of the chapter on "Thermal Conduction in Fluids" in the sixth volume of L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz's "Course of Theoretical Physics". It might be used to measure the heat transfer and air flow in a domestic refrigerator, to do a harmonic analysis of regenerators, or to understand the physics of glaciers.



The Marangoni effect is also significant in transport phenomena, as it plays a crucial role in the transfer of heat and mass at the interface between two phases. It is particularly relevant in situations where there is a significant temperature or concentration gradient, such as in boiling or evaporation processes. Understanding and controlling Marangoni flows is essential in optimizing these processes and improving their efficiency.



## Significance to transport phenomena



Under earth conditions, the Marangoni effect can have a significant impact on the efficiency of heat and mass transfer processes. In microgravity environments, such as in space, the absence of gravity can lead to the dominance of Marangoni flows, making it a crucial factor to consider in designing and operating systems involving fluid interfaces.



In conclusion, Marangoni flows are a fascinating and complex phenomenon that plays a crucial role in various fields of science and engineering. From understanding the behavior of fluids at interfaces to optimizing processes involving heat and mass transfer, the Marangoni effect has significant applications and implications in transport phenomena.

This equation is essential in understanding the behavior of fluids in confined spaces, such as capillary tubes, where the curvature of the interface plays a significant role.



$$

v_{i} {\partial \sigma_{ij}\over{\partial x_{j}}} = {\partial\over{\partial x_{j}}}\left(\sigma_{ij}v_{i} \right ) - \sigma_{ij}{\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}} \\

\rho {\partial k\over{\partial t}} = -\rho {\bf v}\cdot\nabla k - \rho {\bf v}\cdot\nabla h + \rho T{\bf v}\cdot\nabla s + \nabla\cdot\left(\rho D\nabla s\right)

$$



### Subsection: 5.1b Marangoni Flow Mechanisms



There are several mechanisms that can drive Marangoni flows, including thermal, concentration, and surface tension gradients. In thermal Marangoni flows, the surface tension gradient is caused by a temperature difference between two points on the interface. This can occur due to external heating or cooling, or due to a temperature difference between the two phases.



In concentration Marangoni flows, the surface tension gradient is caused by a difference in solute concentration at the interface. This can occur when a solute is added to one side of the interface, causing a change in surface tension and driving a flow towards the lower concentration side.



Surface tension gradients can also be caused by differences in surface composition, known as surfactant Marangoni flows. This can occur when a surfactant is added to one side of the interface, causing a change in surface tension and driving a flow towards the lower concentration side.



### Subsection: 5.1c Marangoni Flow Applications



Marangoni flows have a wide range of applications in various fields, including engineering, physics, and chemistry. In the field of engineering, Marangoni flows are used in the design of heating elements, such as electrode boilers, where electricity is used to create steam through streams of water. The FLOW-3D software has been used to optimize the design of fish ladders and emergency overflows, as well as to predict the complex flow and thermal control in high pressure die casting processes.



In physics, Marangoni flows have been studied in the context of fluid dynamics and heat transfer. The Young-Laplace equation has been used to understand the behavior of fluids in confined spaces, such as capillary tubes, and the general equation for heat transfer has been modified to include the effects of surface tension gradients in Marangoni flows.



In chemistry, Marangoni flows have been used in the optimization of coating processes for technologies such as active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) displays. The FLOW-3D software has been used to predict the performance of printhead designs in inkjet printers, and to evaluate the performance of highway pavement and drainage inlets with different geometries.



Overall, Marangoni flows play a crucial role in understanding and predicting the behavior of fluids at interfaces, and their applications continue to expand in various fields.

## Chapter 6: Marangoni Flows II



### Section 6.1: Fluid Jets



In this section, we will explore the phenomenon of fluid jets and their role in Marangoni flows. Fluid jets are thin streams of fluid that are ejected from a nozzle or orifice due to the pressure difference between the fluid and its surroundings. These jets can be found in various natural and industrial processes, such as in the formation of raindrops, inkjet printing, and fuel injection in engines.



#### 6.1a: Introduction to Fluid Jets



Fluid jets play a crucial role in Marangoni flows as they are often the primary mechanism for the transport of mass and momentum between different phases. The formation and behavior of fluid jets are strongly influenced by the interfacial tension between the fluid and its surroundings. This is because the interfacial tension acts as a resistance to the deformation of the fluid surface, which in turn affects the shape and stability of the jet.



One of the most well-known examples of fluid jets in Marangoni flows is the bead-on-string structure. In this structure, a small bead of fluid is suspended between two larger beads, forming a string-like structure. As the smaller bead drains out due to gravity, it moves towards the adjacent beads, eventually merging with them. This process is known as drop draining and is a result of the Marangoni effect, where the surface tension gradient between the smaller and larger beads drives the fluid flow.



Another important phenomenon involving fluid jets is drop merging, where two adjacent beads of fluid move close to each other and merge to form a single bead. This process is also driven by the Marangoni effect, as the surface tension gradient between the two beads causes them to move towards each other.



In addition to drop draining and merging, fluid jets also play a role in drop collision and oscillation. In drop collision, two adjacent beads of fluid collide and merge to form a single bead, while in drop oscillation, the two beads start oscillating and eventually merge due to the surface tension gradient between them.



The behavior of fluid jets in Marangoni flows is also affected by the presence of surfactants, which are molecules that can reduce the interfacial tension between two phases. Surfactants can either enhance or suppress the Marangoni effect, depending on their concentration and properties. This makes them a useful tool for controlling and manipulating fluid jets in various applications.



In conclusion, fluid jets are an essential aspect of Marangoni flows and play a crucial role in the transport of mass and momentum between different phases. Their behavior is strongly influenced by the interfacial tension and can be controlled by the presence of surfactants. In the next section, we will explore the effects of temperature gradients on fluid jets and their applications in various industrial processes.

## Chapter 7: Instability Dynamics



### Section 7.1: Fluid Sheets



In this section, we will focus on the dynamics of fluid sheets, which are thin layers of fluid bounded by two interfaces. These interfaces can be solid-liquid, liquid-gas, or liquid-liquid, and the behavior of the fluid sheet is greatly influenced by the properties of these interfaces.



Fluid sheets are commonly found in various natural and industrial processes, such as thin films in coating applications, liquid layers in emulsions, and thin layers of liquid in foams. The behavior of these fluid sheets is crucial in determining the stability and overall behavior of the system.



#### Subsection 7.1a: Introduction to Fluid Sheets



Before delving into the dynamics of fluid sheets, let us first define some key terms. A fluid sheet is a thin layer of fluid with a thickness much smaller than its length and width. This thinness allows for the sheet to be treated as a two-dimensional system, greatly simplifying the analysis.



The behavior of fluid sheets is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in a fluid. These equations can be simplified for a two-dimensional system, resulting in the thin film equation:



$$

\rho {\partial h\over{\partial t}} = -\nabla\cdot(\rho h{\bf v})

$$



where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $h$ is the thickness of the fluid sheet, and ${\bf v}$ is the velocity of the fluid.



One of the key factors that influence the behavior of fluid sheets is surface tension. Surface tension is the force per unit length acting on the surface of a fluid due to the cohesive forces between its molecules. This force tends to minimize the surface area of the fluid, resulting in the formation of droplets or bubbles.



Another important factor is the presence of gradients, such as temperature or concentration gradients, which can lead to instabilities in the fluid sheet. These instabilities can result in the formation of patterns, such as waves or droplets, which greatly affect the behavior of the system.



In the next section, we will explore the different types of instabilities that can occur in fluid sheets and their underlying mechanisms. By understanding these instabilities, we can gain insights into the behavior of fluid sheets and use this knowledge to control and manipulate them in various applications.

#### Subsection 7.1b: Fluid Sheet Phenomena



In addition to the general behavior of fluid sheets, there are several specific phenomena that are of interest in the study of interfacial dynamics. These include drop draining, visco-elastic jets, and beads on string structures.



##### Drop Draining



Drop draining is a phenomenon that occurs when a small droplet of fluid is placed on a surface and begins to spread out. This process is governed by the balance between surface tension, which tends to minimize the surface area of the droplet, and viscous forces, which resist the motion of the fluid. As the droplet spreads out, it forms a thin film of fluid that can exhibit various instabilities, such as fingering or buckling.



##### Visco-Elastic Jets



Visco-elastic jets are thin streams of fluid that are stretched and elongated due to the presence of surface tension and elasticity. These jets are commonly found in industrial processes, such as inkjet printing and spray coating, and their behavior is influenced by the properties of the fluid and the surrounding environment.



##### Beads on String Structure



In this phenomenon, a thin layer of fluid is stretched between two solid surfaces, forming a string-like structure with small beads along its length. This structure is commonly seen in coating applications, where the fluid is spread out between two moving surfaces. The formation and behavior of these beads on string structures are influenced by the properties of the fluid, the surface tension, and the speed and direction of the moving surfaces.



## Application



The understanding of fluid sheet phenomena has many practical applications. For example, the thin film equation can be used to model the behavior of thin films in coating applications, allowing for the optimization of coating processes. The study of visco-elastic jets is crucial in the development of inkjet printing technology, which is widely used in various industries. Additionally, the formation and behavior of beads on string structures are important in the design and optimization of coating processes in industries such as food and pharmaceuticals.



In conclusion, the dynamics of fluid sheets play a crucial role in various natural and industrial processes. By understanding the behavior of fluid sheets and the specific phenomena that occur within them, we can improve and optimize processes in various industries and gain a deeper understanding of interfacial phenomena.

There are several types of instabilities that can occur in fluid sheets, each with its own unique characteristics and causes. Some of the most common instabilities include Rayleigh-Plateau instability, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and Marangoni instability.



Rayleigh-Plateau instability occurs when a fluid sheet is subjected to a disturbance, such as a change in thickness or velocity. This can result in the formation of droplets or bubbles along the surface of the sheet, as the surface tension tries to minimize the surface area.



Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, on the other hand, occurs when there is a velocity difference between two fluids at their interface. This can lead to the formation of vortices and waves, as the faster fluid tries to mix with the slower fluid.



Marangoni instability is caused by surface tension gradients, such as those created by temperature or concentration differences. This can result in the formation of patterns, such as stripes or cells, on the surface of the fluid sheet.



#### Subsection 7.1c: Fluid Sheet Applications



The understanding of fluid sheet dynamics and instabilities has many practical applications in various industries. One of the most common applications is in coating processes, where a thin layer of liquid is applied to a surface. The stability of the fluid sheet is crucial in ensuring an even and uniform coating.



In the food industry, the formation of emulsions and foams relies on the stability of fluid sheets. Understanding the instabilities that can occur in these systems is important in controlling the texture and stability of food products.



In the field of microfluidics, the manipulation of fluid sheets is used in various lab-on-a-chip devices for applications such as drug delivery and chemical analysis. The control of fluid sheet instabilities is crucial in the proper functioning of these devices.

### Section 8.1 Contact Angle Hysteresis



Contact angle hysteresis is a phenomenon that occurs at the interface between a liquid and a solid surface. It is defined as the difference between the advancing contact angle (θ<sub>a</sub>) and the receding contact angle (θ<sub>r</sub>). This difference is caused by the non-ideal nature of real surfaces, which do not have perfect smoothness, rigidity, or chemical homogeneity.



When the contact angle is between the advancing and receding cases, the contact line is considered to be pinned and hysteretic behavior can be observed. This means that the contact angle will not change until a certain threshold is reached. This threshold is determined by the advancing and receding contact angles, with the advancing contact angle being the maximum stable angle and the receding contact angle being the minimum stable angle.



The difference in contact angles is due to the presence of metastable states on non-ideal surfaces. These states are thermodynamically stable and can result in varying contact angles. This is known as dynamic wetting, where the contact line is in motion and the contact angle is related to the velocity of the contact line.



The difference between dynamic and static wetting angles is proportional to the capillary number, <math>Ca</math>. As the contact line advances, the contact angle increases and is generally related to the velocity of the contact line. However, if the velocity of the contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle will approach 180° and the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is known as kinetic nonequilibrium and occurs when the contact line moves at a high speed, preventing complete wetting from occurring.



One common cause of non-ideal surfaces is surface roughness. Rough surfaces can be classified into two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous roughness refers to surfaces with a consistent rough texture, while heterogeneous roughness refers to surfaces with varying roughness. Both types of roughness can contribute to contact angle hysteresis.



In conclusion, contact angle hysteresis is a result of the non-ideal nature of real surfaces and can have a significant impact on the stability of superposed fluids. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial in predicting and controlling the behavior of these systems. In the following subsection, we will explore the different types of instabilities that can occur at the interface between two fluids.

### Section 8.1 Contact Angle Hysteresis



Contact angle hysteresis is a phenomenon that occurs at the interface between a liquid and a solid surface. It is defined as the difference between the advancing contact angle ($\theta_a$) and the receding contact angle ($\theta_r$). This difference is caused by the non-ideal nature of real surfaces, which do not have perfect smoothness, rigidity, or chemical homogeneity.



When the contact angle is between the advancing and receding cases, the contact line is considered to be pinned and hysteretic behavior can be observed.

Homogeneous roughness refers to surfaces with a consistent roughness pattern, while heterogeneous roughness refers to surfaces with varying roughness patterns. Both types of roughness can contribute to contact angle hysteresis.



### Subsection: 8.1b Contact Angle Hysteresis Phenomena



Contact angle hysteresis phenomena can be observed in various systems, including liquid droplets on solid surfaces, liquid bridges between two solid surfaces, and liquid films on solid surfaces. In each case, the contact angle hysteresis is influenced by factors such as surface roughness, surface chemistry, and liquid properties.



One example of contact angle hysteresis phenomena is the Cassie-Baxter wetting state. In this state, a liquid droplet on a rough surface can exist in a metastable state with a contact angle that is different from the equilibrium contact angle. This is due to the presence of air pockets between the droplet and the surface, which can affect the wetting behavior.



Another example is the Wenzel wetting state, where a liquid droplet on a rough surface can spread out and conform to the surface roughness. This results in an increased contact area and a higher contact angle compared to the Cassie-Baxter state. The Wenzel state is often observed in superhydrophobic surfaces, where the contact angle can be significantly higher than the equilibrium contact angle.



Contact angle hysteresis phenomena also play a role in the stability of liquid bridges between two solid surfaces. The contact angle hysteresis can affect the shape and stability of the liquid bridge, which is important in applications such as adhesion and lubrication.



In conclusion, contact angle hysteresis is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by various factors and can be observed in different systems. Understanding and controlling contact angle hysteresis is crucial in many practical applications and continues to be an active area of research in interfacial phenomena.

### Section 8.2 Wetting of Textured Solids



Wetting of textured solids is a complex phenomenon that occurs at the interface between a liquid and a solid surface. It is influenced by various factors such as surface roughness, chemical heterogeneity, and viscoelastic properties of the liquid. In this section, we will discuss the different aspects of wetting of textured solids and its implications in interfacial phenomena.



#### Introduction to Wetting of Textured Solids



Wetting of textured solids is a crucial aspect of interfacial phenomena, as it plays a significant role in various industrial processes such as coating, adhesion, and lubrication. It is defined as the ability of a liquid to spread over a solid surface and form a thin film. The degree of wetting is determined by the contact angle, which is the angle formed between the liquid-solid interface and the tangent to the liquid surface at the point of contact.



The contact angle is influenced by the surface properties of the solid, such as roughness and chemical composition, as well as the properties of the liquid, such as surface tension and viscosity. In the case of textured solids, the contact angle can vary significantly due to the presence of surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity. This results in contact angle hysteresis, where the advancing and receding contact angles are different.



#### Effects of Surface Roughness



Surface roughness is a common cause of non-ideal surfaces and can significantly affect the wetting behavior of a liquid on a solid surface. Rough surfaces can be classified into two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous roughness refers to surfaces with a uniform roughness pattern, while heterogeneous roughness refers to surfaces with irregular roughness patterns.



In the case of homogeneous roughness, the contact angle is affected by the average roughness of the surface. As the roughness increases, the contact angle also increases, resulting in a decrease in wetting. This is due to the increase in the contact area between the liquid and the solid, resulting in a decrease in the effective surface energy.



On the other hand, heterogeneous roughness can result in varying contact angles due to the presence of different roughness patterns on the surface. This can lead to contact angle hysteresis and dynamic wetting behavior, where the contact angle changes as the contact line moves.



#### Effects of Chemical Heterogeneity



Chemical heterogeneity refers to the variation in chemical composition on a solid surface. This can occur due to the presence of impurities or surface treatments. Chemical heterogeneity can significantly affect the wetting behavior of a liquid on a solid surface, as it can alter the surface energy and surface tension of the liquid.



In the case of chemical heterogeneity, the contact angle can vary significantly depending on the chemical composition of the surface. This can result in contact angle hysteresis and dynamic wetting behavior, similar to the effects of surface roughness.



#### Effects of Viscoelastic Properties



The viscoelastic properties of a liquid can also influence the wetting behavior on a textured solid surface. Viscoelasticity refers to the ability of a material to exhibit both viscous and elastic properties. In the case of wetting, the viscoelastic properties of the liquid can affect the contact angle and the dynamics of the contact line.



For example, in the case of drop oscillation, the viscoelastic properties of the liquid can result in the oscillation of the contact line, leading to a decrease in the contact angle. This can eventually result in the merging of two adjacent drops.



#### Conclusion



In conclusion, wetting of textured solids is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by various factors such as surface roughness, chemical heterogeneity, and viscoelastic properties of the liquid. Understanding the effects of these factors is crucial in predicting and controlling the wetting behavior of a liquid on a solid surface, which has significant implications in various industrial processes.

The contact angle is influenced by the surface properties of the solid, such as roughness and chemical composition, as well as the properties of the liquid, such as surface tension and viscosity. In the case of textured solids, the contact angle can vary significantly due to the presence of surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity. This results in contact angle hysteresis, where the advancing and receding contact angles are different.



#### Effects of Surface Roughness



Surface roughness is a common cause of non-ideal surfaces and can significantly affect the wetting behavior of a liquid on a solid surface. Rough surfaces can be classified into two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous roughness refers to surfaces with a uniform roughness pattern, while heterogeneous roughness refers to surfaces with irregular roughness patterns.



In the case of homogeneous roughness, the contact angle is affected by the average roughness of the surface. This can be described by the Wenzel equation:



$$

\cos\theta_w = r\cos\theta

$$



Where $\theta_w$ is the contact angle on a rough surface, $\theta$ is the contact angle on a smooth surface, and $r$ is the roughness factor, which is the ratio of the actual surface area to the projected surface area.



On the other hand, heterogeneous roughness can lead to contact angle hysteresis due to the presence of different surface energies on the solid surface. This can be described by the Cassie-Baxter equation:



$$

\cos\theta_c = f_1\cos\theta_1 + f_2\cos\theta_2

$$



Where $\theta_c$ is the contact angle on a heterogeneous surface, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the contact angles on the two different surface regions, and $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the fractional areas of the two regions.



#### Chemical Heterogeneity



Chemical heterogeneity of a solid surface can also affect the wetting behavior of a liquid. This is due to the difference in surface energies of the different chemical regions on the surface. The contact angle on a chemically heterogeneous surface can be described by the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) equation:



$$

\cos\theta_{JKR} = \frac{\gamma_{SL} - \gamma_{SV}}{\gamma_{LV}}

$$



Where $\gamma_{SL}$, $\gamma_{SV}$, and $\gamma_{LV}$ are the surface energies of the solid-liquid, solid-vapor, and liquid-vapor interfaces, respectively.



#### Viscoelastic Properties of the Liquid



The viscoelastic properties of a liquid can also play a role in the wetting behavior on textured solids. In the case of power law fluids, the contact angle can be described by the following equation:



$$

\cos\theta = \left(1 + \frac{t(2n+3)}{4n+2}\left(\frac{(4h_0L_0)^{n+1}F(n+2)}{(2L_0)^{2n+3}Wm}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}\right)^{\frac{n}{2n+3}}

$$



Where $t$ is the time, $n$ is the dimensionless flow behavior index, $h_0$ is the initial film thickness, $L_0$ is the initial contact length, $F$ is the applied force, $W$ is the width of the contact region, and $m$ is the flow consistency index.



#### Conclusion



In conclusion, wetting of textured solids is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by various factors such as surface roughness, chemical heterogeneity, and viscoelastic properties of the liquid. Understanding these factors is crucial in predicting and controlling wetting behavior in various industrial processes. Further research and advancements in this field will lead to more efficient and accurate models for describing wetting on textured solids.

#### Chemical Heterogeneity



Chemical heterogeneity refers to the variation in surface energy due to differences in chemical composition on a solid surface. This can also lead to contact angle hysteresis, as different regions of the surface may have different affinities for the liquid. The van Oss theory is often used to describe the wetting behavior of heterogeneous surfaces, taking into account the acid-base interactions between the liquid and solid.



#### Practical Applications



The wetting of textured solids has various practical applications in materials engineering and characterization. For example, the sessile drop technique, which measures the contact angle of a liquid on a solid surface, is often used to determine the surface tension of liquids. This technique is also useful in characterizing the surface properties of materials, such as surface energy and roughness.



In the case of materials engineering, the wetting of textured solids plays a crucial role in processes such as coating and adhesion. The Fowkes theory, which takes into account the surface energies of both the liquid and solid, is often used to characterize the interactions between the two in these processes. On the other hand, the Owens/Wendt theory, which deals with low energy solid surfaces, is useful in characterizing interactions where the liquid and solid do not have a strong affinity for each other, such as waterproofing.



In conclusion, the wetting of textured solids is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by various factors. Understanding and controlling this phenomenon is crucial in various industrial processes and can be achieved through the use of different theories and techniques.

### Section: 9.1 Coating: Dynamic Contact Lines:



### Subsection: 9.1a Introduction to Coating



Coating is a process in which a thin layer of material is applied to a surface, known as the substrate. This layer can serve various purposes, such as protection, decoration, or functional enhancement. Coatings can be applied in the form of liquids, gases, or solids, depending on the desired properties and application method. In this section, we will focus on the dynamic contact lines in coating processes and how they affect the final product.



#### Dynamic Contact Lines



When a liquid is applied to a solid surface, it forms a contact line where the liquid meets the solid. This contact line is dynamic, meaning it is constantly moving due to the forces acting on it. In coating processes, the dynamic contact line plays a crucial role in determining the thickness and uniformity of the applied coating. 



The movement of the dynamic contact line is governed by the balance of forces at the interface between the liquid, solid, and surrounding air. These forces include surface tension, viscosity, and wetting forces. Surface tension, the cohesive force between liquid molecules, tends to pull the liquid into a spherical shape, while viscosity, the resistance to flow, causes the liquid to spread out. Wetting forces, which depend on the surface chemistry of the liquid and solid, determine whether the liquid will spread or retract at the contact line. 



#### Factors Affecting Dynamic Contact Lines



Several factors can affect the behavior of dynamic contact lines in coating processes. One of the most significant factors is the surface chemistry of the liquid and solid. If the liquid has a lower surface tension than the solid, it will tend to spread out and form a thin coating. On the other hand, if the liquid has a higher surface tension, it will form droplets on the surface, resulting in a thicker coating. 



Surface roughness also plays a crucial role in dynamic contact lines. A rough surface can disrupt the balance of forces at the interface, leading to irregularities in the coating thickness. Additionally, the speed at which the liquid is applied and the angle at which it meets the surface can affect the behavior of the dynamic contact line. 



#### Applications of Dynamic Contact Lines in Coating



Dynamic contact lines play a vital role in various coating processes, such as painting, printing, and industrial coating. In painting, the dynamic contact line determines the thickness and coverage of the paint on the surface. In printing, the contact line controls the amount of ink transferred onto the substrate, resulting in high-quality prints. In industrial coating, the dynamic contact line is crucial in achieving a uniform and precise coating on various materials, such as paper, fabric, and metal. 



In conclusion, the dynamic contact line is a critical aspect of coating processes, influencing the final product's quality and properties. Understanding the forces and factors that govern the dynamic contact line is essential in achieving desired coating results. In the following sections, we will explore different types of forced wetting and their applications in various industries. 





## Chapter 9: More Forced Wetting:



### Section: 9.1 Coating: Dynamic Contact Lines:



### Subsection: 9.1b Coating Phenomena



Coating phenomena refer to the various processes and behaviors that occur during the application of a coating to a surface. These phenomena are influenced by the dynamic contact lines, which play a crucial role in determining the final coating thickness and uniformity. In this section, we will explore some of the coating phenomena that are commonly observed in dynamic contact lines.



#### Wetting and Spreading



Wetting is the process by which a liquid spreads over a solid surface. This process is governed by the balance of forces at the interface between the liquid, solid, and surrounding air. As mentioned in the previous section, wetting forces play a crucial role in determining whether the liquid will spread or retract at the contact line. 



When a liquid wets a solid surface, it forms a thin layer that adheres to the surface. This layer is known as the wetting film. The thickness of the wetting film is determined by the balance of forces at the interface. If the wetting forces are stronger than the cohesive forces within the liquid, the film will be thin and uniform. However, if the cohesive forces are stronger, the film will be thicker and may even form droplets on the surface.



Spreading is the process by which a liquid expands over a surface due to the action of surface tension. This process is also influenced by the wetting forces, as a liquid with a lower surface tension will spread more easily than a liquid with a higher surface tension. The rate of spreading is also affected by the viscosity of the liquid, with more viscous liquids spreading slower than less viscous ones.



#### Dewetting and Pinning



Dewetting is the opposite of wetting, where a liquid retracts from a solid surface. This can occur when the wetting forces are weaker than the cohesive forces within the liquid. In this case, the liquid will form droplets on the surface, resulting in an uneven coating. Dewetting can also occur due to the presence of impurities on the surface, which can disrupt the balance of forces at the interface.



Pinning is a phenomenon that occurs when the contact line is unable to move due to the presence of surface defects or impurities. This can result in an uneven coating, as the liquid is unable to spread uniformly over the surface. Pinning can also occur due to the presence of surface roughness, which can create local variations in the wetting forces.



#### Evaporation and Drying



During the coating process, the liquid layer on the surface will eventually evaporate, leaving behind a solid coating. The rate of evaporation is influenced by factors such as temperature, humidity, and the properties of the liquid. As the liquid evaporates, the concentration of solutes in the remaining liquid increases, which can affect the wetting and spreading behavior.



Drying is the final stage of the coating process, where the remaining liquid completely evaporates, leaving behind a solid coating. This process can be affected by factors such as temperature, humidity, and the properties of the liquid. Drying can also result in the formation of defects, such as cracks or wrinkles, if the coating is not applied properly or if the drying conditions are not optimal.



#### Conclusion



Coating phenomena are complex and are influenced by a variety of factors. The dynamic contact lines play a crucial role in determining the behavior of these phenomena, and understanding their influence is essential for achieving a successful coating process. In the next section, we will explore some of the techniques and methods used to control and manipulate dynamic contact lines in coating processes.





## Chapter 9: More Forced Wetting:



### Section: 9.1 Coating: Dynamic Contact Lines:



### Subsection: 9.1c Coating Applications



In the previous section, we explored the various coating phenomena that occur at dynamic contact lines. These phenomena play a crucial role in determining the final coating thickness and uniformity. In this section, we will discuss some of the applications of coating using dynamic contact lines.



#### Coating for Protection and Enhancement



One of the most common applications of coating is for protection and enhancement of surfaces. Coatings can provide a barrier against corrosion, wear, and other forms of damage. They can also enhance the surface properties, such as hardness, lubricity, and chemical resistance. Dynamic contact lines play a crucial role in achieving a uniform and effective coating for these purposes.



For example, in the case of carbonitriding, a coating process used for case hardening, the dynamic contact lines determine the thickness and uniformity of the coating on gear teeth, cams, shafts, and other components. The wetting and spreading phenomena at the contact line ensure that the coating adheres uniformly to the surface, providing protection against wear and corrosion.



Similarly, in the case of austenitic stainless steel, the dynamic contact lines play a crucial role in achieving a uniform and corrosion-resistant coating. The wetting and spreading phenomena ensure that the coating adheres uniformly to the surface, providing protection against corrosion and enhancing the surface properties.



#### Coating for Functional Purposes



Coatings can also be applied for functional purposes, such as for their optical, electrical, or thermal properties. In these cases, the dynamic contact lines play a crucial role in achieving the desired coating thickness and uniformity, which is essential for the functionality of the coating.



For example, in the case of cold spraying, a coating process used for depositing materials that are phase-sensitive or temperature-sensitive, the dynamic contact lines play a crucial role in achieving a uniform and precise coating. The wetting and spreading phenomena ensure that the coating adheres uniformly to the surface, providing the desired functional properties.



#### Coating for Repair and Manufacturing



Dynamic contact lines are also crucial in coating applications for repair and manufacturing purposes. In the case of repair, coatings can be used to restore damaged surfaces quickly and efficiently. The wetting and spreading phenomena at the dynamic contact lines ensure that the coating adheres uniformly to the damaged surface, providing a strong and durable repair.



In manufacturing, coatings can be applied using dynamic contact lines for additive manufacturing processes. This allows for the precise and uniform deposition of materials, which is essential for the production of complex and functional components. The wetting and spreading phenomena at the dynamic contact lines ensure that the coating adheres uniformly to the surface, providing the desired properties for the manufactured component.



In conclusion, dynamic contact lines play a crucial role in coating applications for protection, enhancement, functionality, repair, and manufacturing. The wetting and spreading phenomena at these contact lines ensure that the coating adheres uniformly to the surface, providing the desired properties and functionality. Further developments in coating technology, such as the use of cold spraying for depositing ceramic materials and the use of additive manufacturing, continue to expand the possibilities and applications of coating using dynamic contact lines.

## Chapter: Interfacial Phenomena: A Comprehensive Guide



### Introduction



In this chapter, we will be discussing the topic of spreading in interfacial phenomena. Spreading is a common phenomenon that occurs at the interface between two different phases, such as a liquid and a solid or two immiscible liquids. It is the process by which a liquid or a gas spreads over a surface, forming a thin layer. This phenomenon is of great importance in various fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology.



The spreading process is driven by the intermolecular forces between the molecules of the liquid and the molecules of the surface. These forces can be attractive or repulsive, and they determine the extent to which the liquid can spread over the surface. The spreading process can be influenced by various factors, such as the properties of the liquid and the surface, the temperature, and the presence of impurities.



In this chapter, we will explore the different aspects of spreading, including the mechanisms involved, the factors that affect it, and the applications of spreading in various fields. We will also discuss the mathematical models and theories that have been developed to describe and predict the spreading behavior. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of spreading and its significance in interfacial phenomena.

### Section: 10.1 Water Waves:



Water waves are a common and fascinating phenomenon that can be observed in oceans, lakes, and even in a glass of water. They are created by the interaction of wind with the surface of a body of water, and they can travel long distances before dissipating. In this section, we will discuss the basic principles of water waves and their behavior.



#### 10.1a Introduction to Water Waves



Water waves are a type of surface wave that propagates along the interface between a body of water and the air above it. They are classified as mechanical waves, meaning that they require a medium to travel through. In the case of water waves, the medium is the water itself.



The motion of water waves is a combination of longitudinal and transverse motion. As the wave travels, the water particles move in a circular motion, with the center of the circle being the point where the wave is at its highest. This motion is known as orbital motion and is responsible for the characteristic shape of water waves.



The behavior of water waves is governed by a set of equations known as the Boussinesq equations. These equations were first derived by Joseph Boussinesq in the late 19th century and have since been refined and extended by other researchers. They describe the motion of water waves on an incompressible fluid and assume that the flow is irrotational, meaning that there is no net rotation of the water particles.



The Boussinesq equations are derived by applying the Boussinesq approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of fluids. This approximation involves neglecting higher-order terms in the equations, resulting in a simplified set of equations that are easier to solve. The resulting equations are then used to model the behavior of water waves in different scenarios.



One of the most important applications of the Boussinesq equations is in the study of shallow water waves. These are waves that occur in water that is relatively shallow compared to the wavelength of the wave. In this case, the Boussinesq equations can be simplified even further, resulting in the well-known shallow water equations.



In recent years, there have been efforts to extend the Boussinesq equations to account for more complex scenarios, such as waves in non-uniform water depth and waves in the presence of currents. These extensions have allowed for more accurate predictions of water wave behavior and have been applied in various fields, including oceanography, coastal engineering, and offshore structures.



In the next section, we will discuss one of the most well-known types of water waves - the Stokes wave. We will explore its properties, derivation, and modern extensions.

These are waves that occur in water depths that are much smaller than the wavelength of the wave. In this case, the Boussinesq equations can be simplified even further to the shallow water equations, which are commonly used to model the behavior of waves in coastal regions.



### Subsection: 10.1b Water Wave Phenomena



Water waves exhibit a variety of interesting phenomena that have been studied extensively by researchers. One such phenomenon is wave dispersion, which refers to the fact that different wavelengths of water waves travel at different speeds. This is due to the fact that longer wavelengths have a higher velocity than shorter wavelengths, resulting in a separation of the wave into its component wavelengths.



Another important phenomenon is wave breaking, which occurs when the height of a wave becomes too large and the wave collapses onto itself. This can happen due to a variety of factors, such as changes in water depth or the presence of obstacles in the water. Wave breaking is an important consideration in coastal engineering, as it can cause significant damage to structures and shorelines.



In addition to these phenomena, water waves also exhibit interesting interactions with other waves and objects in the water. For example, when two waves of the same wavelength meet, they can either constructively or destructively interfere with each other, resulting in a larger or smaller wave, respectively. This can also happen when waves meet objects in the water, such as piers or ships, resulting in complex wave patterns and forces on the objects.



Understanding these phenomena is crucial for a variety of applications, such as predicting wave behavior in coastal regions, designing offshore structures, and studying the effects of climate change on ocean waves. As our understanding of water waves continues to improve, we are able to better predict and mitigate the impacts of these powerful and dynamic phenomena.

### Subsection: 10.1c Water Wave Applications



Water waves have a wide range of applications in various fields, including engineering, oceanography, and even entertainment. In this subsection, we will discuss some of the most common applications of water waves.



#### 10.1c.1 Coastal Engineering



Coastal engineering is a branch of civil engineering that deals with the design and construction of structures along coastlines. Water waves play a crucial role in this field, as they can cause erosion and damage to coastal structures. Therefore, understanding the behavior of water waves is essential in designing and maintaining coastal structures such as breakwaters, seawalls, and jetties.



The Boussinesq equations, along with other wave models such as the Mild Slope Equation and the Tomawac model, are commonly used in coastal engineering to predict wave heights and wave forces on structures. These models take into account factors such as wave height, wave period, and water depth to accurately predict the behavior of water waves in a specific location.



#### 10.1c.2 Oceanography



Oceanography is the study of the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of the ocean. Water waves are an important aspect of oceanography, as they play a significant role in ocean circulation and the transport of heat and nutrients. Understanding the behavior of water waves is crucial in predicting ocean currents and studying the effects of climate change on the ocean.



The Boussinesq equations, along with other wave models such as the ARTEMIS model, are commonly used in oceanography to study the propagation of waves in the ocean. These models can also be used to study the effects of storms and other extreme weather events on the ocean.



#### 10.1c.3 Entertainment



Water waves are not only important in scientific and engineering applications, but they also have a significant impact on entertainment. Surfing, for example, is a popular water sport that relies on the behavior of water waves. Understanding the physics of water waves can help surfers predict and catch the best waves.

## Chapter 11: Interfacial Tension



### Section 11.1: Interfacial Tension Theory



Interfacial tension is a fundamental concept in the study of interfacial phenomena. It refers to the force per unit length acting at the interface between two immiscible phases, such as a liquid and a gas. This force arises due to the imbalance of intermolecular forces at the interface, and it plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of interfaces.



In this section, we will explore the theoretical foundations of interfacial tension. We will begin by defining interfacial tension and discussing its physical significance. We will then derive the Young-Laplace equation, which relates the interfacial tension to the curvature of the interface. Finally, we will discuss the implications of interfacial tension in different systems.



#### 11.1a: Introduction to Interfacial Tension



Interfacial tension is defined as the force per unit length acting at the interface between two immiscible phases. It is denoted by the symbol $\sigma$ and has units of force per unit length (N/m). This force arises due to the imbalance of intermolecular forces at the interface, where the molecules of one phase are attracted to each other more strongly than they are to the molecules of the other phase.



The physical significance of interfacial tension can be understood by considering a liquid droplet suspended in air. The molecules at the surface of the droplet experience a net inward force due to the imbalance of intermolecular forces, resulting in a decrease in the surface area of the droplet. This is why droplets tend to form spherical shapes, as this minimizes the surface area for a given volume.



The Young-Laplace equation is a fundamental equation in the study of interfacial tension. It relates the interfacial tension to the curvature of the interface and is given by:



$$

\Delta P = \sigma \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)

$$



where $\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the interface, $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the principal radii of curvature of the interface. This equation shows that the interfacial tension is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature, meaning that the smaller the radius of curvature, the higher the interfacial tension.



The implications of interfacial tension can be seen in various systems, such as the formation of droplets, bubbles, and emulsions. In these systems, the interfacial tension plays a crucial role in determining the stability and behavior of the interfaces. For example, in the case of emulsions, the interfacial tension between the two immiscible liquids must be low enough to prevent the droplets from coalescing.



In conclusion, interfacial tension is a fundamental concept in the study of interfacial phenomena. It is defined as the force per unit length acting at the interface between two immiscible phases and plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of interfaces. In the next section, we will explore the various methods used to measure interfacial tension.

This is why droplets tend to form spherical shapes, as this minimizes the surface area for a given volume.



#### 11.1b: Interfacial Tension Phenomena



Interfacial tension plays a crucial role in various phenomena, such as capillary action, wetting, and emulsions. Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow against gravity in a narrow tube or porous material. This phenomenon is due to the intermolecular forces between the liquid and the tube or material, which create a meniscus and cause the liquid to rise or fall.



Wetting is the ability of a liquid to spread over a solid surface. This is also influenced by intermolecular forces, where the liquid molecules are attracted to the solid surface more strongly than to each other. The degree of wetting is determined by the contact angle between the liquid and the solid surface, with a lower contact angle indicating better wetting.



Emulsions are mixtures of two immiscible liquids, such as oil and water. The stability of an emulsion is dependent on the interfacial tension between the two liquids. If the interfacial tension is high, the liquids will separate, but if it is low, the liquids will remain mixed. This is why emulsifiers, which lower the interfacial tension, are often added to emulsions to improve their stability.



#### 11.1c: The Young-Laplace Equation



The Young-Laplace equation is a fundamental equation in the study of interfacial tension. It relates the interfacial tension to the curvature of the interface and is given by:



$$

\Delta P = \sigma \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)

$$



where $\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the interface, $\sigma$ is the interfacial tension, and $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the principal radii of curvature of the interface. This equation can be derived from the balance of forces at the interface, taking into account the surface tension forces and the pressure difference.



#### 11.1d: Implications of Interfacial Tension



The Young-Laplace equation has important implications in various systems. For example, in the case of a liquid droplet suspended in air, the pressure inside the droplet is higher than the pressure outside due to the surface tension forces. This results in a positive pressure difference, causing the droplet to shrink in size.



In the case of a soap bubble, the pressure inside the bubble is lower than the pressure outside due to the surface tension forces. This results in a negative pressure difference, causing the bubble to expand in size. This is why soap bubbles tend to have a spherical shape, as this minimizes the surface area for a given volume.



In conclusion, interfacial tension is a fundamental concept in the study of interfacial phenomena. It plays a crucial role in various phenomena and can be described by the Young-Laplace equation. Understanding interfacial tension is essential for understanding the behavior of interfaces and their impact on different systems.

#### 11.1a: Introduction to Interfacial Tension



Interfacial tension is denoted by the symbol $\sigma$ and has units of force per unit length (N/m). It is a measure of the energy required to create a unit area of interface between two phases. This energy arises due to the imbalance of intermolecular forces at the interface, where the molecules of one phase are attracted to each other more strongly than they are to the molecules of the other phase.



The physical significance of interfacial tension can be understood by considering a liquid droplet suspended in air. The molecules at the surface of the droplet experience a net inward force due to the imbalance of intermolecular forces, resulting in a decrease in the surface area of the droplet. This is why droplets tend to form spherical shapes, as this minimizes the surface area for a given volume.



#### 11.1b: Interfacial Tension Phenomena



Interfacial tension plays a crucial role in various phenomena, such as capillary action, wetting, and emulsions. Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow against gravity in a narrow tube or porous material. This is due to the intermolecular forces between the liquid and the solid surface, which create a meniscus that pulls the liquid up the tube. The magnitude of the capillary rise is directly related to the interfacial tension between the liquid and the solid.



Wetting is another important phenomenon influenced by interfacial tension. It refers to the ability of a liquid to spread over a solid surface. The degree of wetting is determined by the balance between the intermolecular forces of the liquid and the solid surface. A liquid with a higher interfacial tension will have a lower wetting angle and will spread more easily over the surface.



Emulsions, which are mixtures of two immiscible liquids, are also affected by interfacial tension. The interfacial tension between the two liquids plays a crucial role in the stability of the emulsion. A lower interfacial tension will result in a more stable emulsion, as the two liquids will be less likely to separate.



#### 11.1c: Interfacial Tension Applications



The understanding of interfacial tension has many practical applications, particularly in the field of materials science. One important application is in grain boundary engineering, where the interfacial energy of grain boundaries is manipulated to enhance mechanical properties. By controlling the interfacial energy, it is possible to engineer materials with desirable grain boundary characteristics, such as increased interfacial area, higher grain boundary density, or specific grain boundary types.



Introducing alloying elements into a material can alter the interfacial energy of grain boundaries. This can result in segregation of solute atoms at the grain boundaries, which can modify the atomic arrangements and bonding, and thereby influence the mechanical properties of the material. This is a key aspect of grain boundary strengthening, where the interfacial energy plays a crucial role in impeding dislocation motion and enhancing the strength of the material.



In conclusion, interfacial tension is a fundamental concept in the study of interfacial phenomena. It plays a crucial role in various phenomena and has many practical applications in materials science. By understanding and manipulating interfacial tension, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of interfaces and engineer materials with desirable properties.

### Introduction



In this chapter, we will explore the topic of surface forces, which is an important aspect of interfacial phenomena. Interfacial phenomena refers to the study of physical and chemical processes that occur at the interface between two phases, such as a solid-liquid or liquid-gas interface. Surface forces play a crucial role in determining the behavior and properties of these interfaces, and understanding them is essential for a comprehensive understanding of interfacial phenomena.



In this chapter, we will cover various topics related to surface forces, including the different types of surface forces, their origins, and their effects on interfacial behavior. We will also discuss the mathematical models and theories that have been developed to describe and predict surface forces. Additionally, we will explore the applications of surface forces in various fields, such as materials science, biology, and engineering.



Surface forces can be broadly classified into two categories: long-range and short-range forces.

These forces can significantly influence the properties of interfaces, such as surface tension, wetting behavior, and adhesion. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of surface forces is crucial for controlling and manipulating interfacial behavior in various applications.



In this chapter, we will also discuss the mathematical models and theories that have been developed to describe and predict surface forces. These include the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, which describes the interaction between colloidal particles, and the Derjaguin approximation, which is used to calculate the force between two flat surfaces.



Finally, we will explore the applications of surface forces in various fields. These include the design of self-cleaning surfaces, the development of biomaterials, and the fabrication of micro- and nanoscale devices.

## Chapter 12: Surface Forces



### Section 12.1: Surface Force Theory



Surface forces play a crucial role in determining the behavior and properties of interfaces between two phases. In this section, we will explore the theory behind surface forces and their effects on interfacial behavior.



#### 12.1a: Introduction to Surface Forces



Surface forces are the result of interactions between molecules at the interface between two phases. These forces can be broadly classified into two categories: long-range and short-range forces. Long-range forces, also known as van der Waals forces, act over large distances and are caused by the interaction between permanent or induced dipoles in molecules. On the other hand, short-range forces, also known as contact forces, act over very small distances and are caused by the repulsion between atoms or molecules when they come into close proximity.



The origin of surface forces can be attributed to various factors, such as electrostatic interactions, steric effects, and solvation effects. These forces can significantly influence the properties of interfaces, such as surface tension, wetting behavior, and adhesion. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of surface forces is crucial for controlling and manipulating interfacial behavior in various applications.



One of the key factors that contribute to surface forces is the presence of a surface itself. When a liquid is confined to a container, one or more surfaces are formed. This introduces new phenomena that are not present in the bulk liquid, as molecules at the surface possess bonds with other liquid molecules only on the inner side of the surface. This results in a net force pulling surface molecules inward, which can be described in terms of energy as the surface tension.



Surface tension is a material property that represents the fixed amount of energy associated with forming a surface of a given area. It is measured in units of energy per unit area (SI units: J/m<sup>2</sup>) and is influenced by the strength of intermolecular forces in the liquid. Liquids with strong intermolecular forces tend to have larger surface tensions.



The presence of surface tension has practical implications, as liquids tend to minimize their surface area, forming spherical drops and bubbles unless other constraints are present. Surface tension is also responsible for a range of other phenomena, including surface waves, capillary action, wetting, and ripples. In liquids under nanoscale confinement, surface effects can play a dominating role since a much greater fraction of molecules are located near a surface compared to a macroscopic sample of liquid.



The surface tension of a liquid also directly affects its wettability. Most common liquids have tensions ranging in the tens of mJ/m<sup>2</sup>, allowing droplets of oil, water, or glue to easily merge and adhere to other surfaces. In contrast, liquid metals such as mercury may have tensions ranging in the hundreds of mJ/m<sup>2</sup>, making it difficult for droplets to combine and surfaces to wet under specific conditions.



It is worth noting that the surface tension of common liquids remains relatively constant under changing conditions such as temperature, in contrast to the enormous variation seen in other mechanical properties, such as viscosity.



In summary, surface forces are an essential aspect of interfacial phenomena, influencing the behavior and properties of interfaces between two phases. Understanding the theory behind surface forces is crucial for controlling and manipulating interfacial behavior in various applications. In the following sections, we will explore the different types of surface forces, their origins, and their effects on interfacial behavior in more detail.

This introduces new phenomena that are not present in the bulk liquid, as molecules at the surface possess bonds with other liquid molecules only on the inner side of the surface. This results in a net force pulling surface molecules inward, which can be described in terms of energy as the surface tension.



Surface tension is a material property that represents the fixed amount of energy associated with forming a surface of a given area. It is measured in units of force per unit length, such as N/m or dyn/cm. Surface tension is a result of the imbalance of intermolecular forces at the surface, as molecules at the surface have fewer neighboring molecules to interact with compared to those in the bulk. This leads to a net inward force, causing the surface to behave like a stretched elastic membrane.



The magnitude of surface tension is dependent on various factors, such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the liquid and its interface with the surrounding medium. For example, surface tension decreases with increasing temperature, as the thermal energy of molecules at the surface increases, making it easier for them to overcome the intermolecular forces and escape into the surrounding medium. Similarly, surface tension also decreases with increasing pressure, as the molecules at the surface are pushed closer together, reducing the imbalance of forces.



In addition to surface tension, other surface forces also play a significant role in interfacial behavior. These include adhesion, cohesion, and wetting behavior. Adhesion is the force of attraction between two different materials at their interface, while cohesion is the force of attraction between molecules of the same material. Wetting behavior refers to the ability of a liquid to spread over a solid surface, and it is influenced by the balance of adhesive and cohesive forces.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different types of surface forces and their effects on interfacial behavior.

Surface tension is a material property that represents the fixed amount of energy associated with forming a surface of a given area. It is measured in units of energy per unit area, such as joules per square meter. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:



$$

\gamma = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta A}

$$



where $\gamma$ is the surface tension, $\Delta E$ is the change in energy, and $\Delta A$ is the change in surface area.



Surface tension is a result of the imbalance of intermolecular forces at the surface of a liquid. Molecules in the bulk of a liquid are surrounded by other molecules on all sides, resulting in balanced forces. However, molecules at the surface only have interactions with molecules on the inner side of the surface, leading to a net inward force. This creates a surface tension that resists any increase in surface area.



Surface tension has many important implications in interfacial phenomena. For example, it is responsible for the spherical shape of liquid droplets, as the surface tension minimizes the surface area of the droplet. It also plays a crucial role in wetting behavior, where the balance between adhesive and cohesive forces determines whether a liquid will spread or bead up on a surface.



In addition to surface tension, other surface forces such as electrostatic interactions and steric effects also play a significant role in interfacial behavior. These forces can be manipulated and controlled to achieve desired properties in various applications.

## Chapter 14: Wetting Dynamics



### Section 14.1: Wetting Dynamics Theory



Wetting dynamics is the study of how a liquid spreads over a solid surface. It is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by various factors, such as surface tension, intermolecular forces, and surface roughness. In this section, we will explore the theoretical foundations of wetting dynamics.



#### Introduction to Wetting Dynamics



Wetting is a ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs in many natural and industrial processes. It is the process by which a liquid spreads over a solid surface, forming a thin film. This process is driven by the minimization of surface energy, as the liquid molecules are attracted to the solid surface due to intermolecular forces.



There are three main types of wetting: complete wetting, partial wetting, and non-wetting. In complete wetting, the liquid spreads completely over the solid surface, forming a thin and uniform film. In partial wetting, the liquid only partially covers the solid surface, leaving some areas exposed. In non-wetting, the liquid forms droplets on the surface and does not spread at all.



The wetting behavior of a liquid is determined by the balance between the surface energies of the solid-liquid, solid-gas, and liquid-gas interfaces. This balance is described by the Young-Dupré equation, which states that the contact angle between the liquid and solid surface is related to the surface energies by:



$$\gamma_{SG} - \gamma_{SL} = \gamma_{LG} \cos\theta$$



where $\gamma_{SG}$ is the surface energy of the solid-gas interface, $\gamma_{SL}$ is the surface energy of the solid-liquid interface, $\gamma_{LG}$ is the surface energy of the liquid-gas interface, and $\theta$ is the contact angle.



#### The Spreading Parameter and Wetting Behavior



The spreading parameter, denoted by $S$, is a useful parameter for gauging wetting behavior. It is defined as:



$$S = \gamma_{SG} - \gamma_{SL} - \gamma_{LG}$$



When $S > 0$, the liquid wets the surface completely (complete wetting). When $S < 0$, partial wetting occurs. The spreading parameter takes into account the surface energies of all three interfaces and provides a more comprehensive understanding of wetting behavior.



Combining the spreading parameter definition with the Young-Dupré equation yields:



$$\gamma_{SG} - \gamma_{SL} = \gamma_{LG} \cos\theta = -S$$



This equation only has physical solutions for $\theta$ when $S < 0$, indicating partial wetting. When $S > 0$, the equation has no physical solutions, indicating complete wetting.



#### A Generalized Model for Contact Angle



With advancements in experimental techniques, researchers have been able to study wetting behavior at smaller scales. This has led to the discovery of new wetting phenomena, such as superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity. These observations have challenged the traditional understanding of wetting dynamics and have led to the development of a generalized model for the contact angle of droplets on flat and curved surfaces.



This model takes into account the effects of surface roughness, surface heterogeneity, and intermolecular forces on wetting behavior. It provides a more accurate description of wetting dynamics at the nanoscale and has been validated by experimental observations.



In conclusion, wetting dynamics theory provides a fundamental understanding of the behavior of liquids at interfaces.

## Chapter 14: Wetting Dynamics



### Section 14.1: Wetting Dynamics Theory



Wetting dynamics is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by various factors, such as surface tension, intermolecular forces, and surface roughness. In this section, we will explore the theoretical foundations of wetting dynamics.



#### Introduction to Wetting Dynamics



Wetting is a ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs in many natural and industrial processes. It is the process by which a liquid spreads over a solid surface, forming a thin film. This process is driven by the minimization of surface energy, as the liquid molecules are attracted to the solid surface due to intermolecular forces.



There are three main types of wetting: complete wetting, partial wetting, and non-wetting. In complete wetting, the liquid spreads completely over the solid surface, forming a thin and uniform film. In partial wetting, the liquid only partially covers the solid surface, leaving some areas exposed. In non-wetting, the liquid forms droplets on the surface and does not spread at all.



The wetting behavior of a liquid is determined by the balance between the surface energies of the solid-liquid, solid-gas, and liquid-gas interfaces. This balance is described by the Young-Dupré equation, which states that the contact angle between the liquid and solid surface is related to the surface energies by:



$$\gamma_{SG} - \gamma_{SL} = \gamma_{LG} \cos\theta$$



where $\gamma_{SG}$ is the surface energy of the solid-gas interface, $\gamma_{SL}$ is the surface energy of the solid-liquid interface, $\gamma_{LG}$ is the surface energy of the liquid-gas interface, and $\theta$ is the contact angle.



#### The Spreading Parameter and Wetting Behavior



The spreading parameter, denoted by $S$, is a useful parameter for gauging wetting behavior. It is defined as:



$$S = \gamma_{SG} - \gamma_{SL} - \gamma_{LG}$$



When $S > 0$, the liquid will spread over the solid surface, indicating complete wetting. When $S < 0$, the liquid will form droplets on the surface, indicating non-wetting. The magnitude of $S$ also affects the wetting behavior. A larger magnitude of $S$ indicates a stronger tendency for the liquid to spread, while a smaller magnitude indicates a weaker tendency for the liquid to spread.



#### Wetting Dynamics Phenomena



In addition to the three main types of wetting, there are also various wetting dynamics phenomena that can occur. These include drop draining, drop merging, drop collision, and drop oscillation.



In drop draining, a small bead of liquid between two larger beads drains out as the fluid particle moves towards the adjacent beads. This can be seen in the figure below.

In drop merging, a smaller bead and a larger bead move close to each other and merge to form a single bead. This can be seen in the figure below.



![Drop Merging](https://i.imgur.com/5yJZ3ZK.png)



In drop collision, two adjacent beads collide to form a single bead. This can be seen in the figure below.



![Drop Collision](https://i.imgur.com/5yJZ3ZK.png)



In drop oscillation, two adjacent beads start oscillating and eventually merge to form a single bead. This can be seen in the figure below.



![Drop Oscillation](https://i.imgur.com/5yJZ3ZK.png)



These wetting dynamics phenomena are important to understand as they can greatly impact the behavior of liquids on solid surfaces.



#### Equilibrium Behavior



To understand the long-term behavior of wetting dynamics, we can look at the equilibrium state of the system. This is determined by the kernel of the discrete Laplace operator, denoted by $L$. The equilibrium state is reached when the only terms that remain in the equation are those where $\lambda_i = 0$, since this indicates that the liquid has reached a steady state.



Since the sum of each row in $L$ is equal to 0, the vector of all ones, denoted by $\mathbf{v}^1$, is in the kernel. This means that for a graph with $k$ disjoint connected components, there will be $k$ independent $\lambda = 0$ eigenvectors of ones and zeros, where each connected component corresponds to an eigenvector with ones at the elements in the connected component and zeros elsewhere.



This has important implications for the equilibrium behavior of a system. For a given initial condition $c(0)$ for a graph with $N$ vertices, the equilibrium state can be written as:



$$\lim_{t \to \infty} c(t) = \sum_{j} \phi_j c_j(0)$$



where $\phi_j$ is the equilibrium state of each vertex $j$ in the graph. In other words, the equilibrium state is determined by the initial condition and the equilibrium state of each individual vertex.



In conclusion, understanding the theoretical foundations of wetting dynamics is crucial for understanding the behavior of liquids on solid surfaces. By considering factors such as surface energy, contact angle, and the spreading parameter, we can gain insight into the various types of wetting and the equilibrium behavior of a system. Additionally, being aware of wetting dynamics phenomena can help us better understand and predict the behavior of liquids on solid surfaces.

When $S > 0$, the liquid will spread over the solid surface, indicating complete wetting. When $S < 0$, the liquid will form droplets on the surface, indicating non-wetting. The magnitude of $S$ also affects the wetting behavior, with larger values leading to more complete wetting and smaller values leading to more non-wetting.



#### Factors Affecting Wetting Dynamics



Wetting dynamics is a complex process that is influenced by various factors. These include surface tension, intermolecular forces, surface roughness, and external forces such as gravity and shear. Surface tension is the force that holds the liquid molecules together and is responsible for the formation of droplets. Intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, play a crucial role in determining the strength of the interaction between the liquid and solid surfaces.



Surface roughness can also affect wetting dynamics, as it can create variations in the surface energy and alter the contact angle. External forces, such as gravity and shear, can also impact wetting dynamics by changing the shape and movement of the liquid on the surface.



#### Applications of Wetting Dynamics



Understanding wetting dynamics is essential in various fields, including materials science, chemical engineering, and biology. In materials science, wetting dynamics plays a crucial role in the development of coatings and adhesives. In chemical engineering, it is important in the design of processes involving liquid-solid interactions, such as in distillation and extraction.



In biology, wetting dynamics is essential for understanding the behavior of biological fluids, such as blood and mucus, on different surfaces. It also plays a role in the functioning of biological systems, such as the wetting of plant leaves by rainwater for photosynthesis.

### Section 16.1: Interfacial Rheology Theory



Interfacial rheology is the study of the mechanical properties of interfaces, such as their elasticity, viscosity, and surface tension. These properties are important in understanding the stability and behavior of interfaces, as well as their interactions with surrounding phases. In this section, we will explore the fundamental principles of interfacial rheology, including the different types of interfaces, the forces that govern their behavior, and the techniques used to measure their mechanical properties.



#### 16.1a: Introduction to Interfacial Rheology



Interfacial rheology deals with the response of the adsorbed interfacial layer on the deformation. The response depends on the layer composition, and thus interfacial rheology is relevant in many applications in which adsorbed layer play a crucial role, for example in development of surfactants, foams, and emulsions. Many biological systems like pulmonary surfactant and meibum also exhibit interfacial rheological properties.



Interfacial rheology can be divided into two main categories: dilatational and shear rheology. In dilatational interfacial rheology, the interfacial area is allowed to change during the measurement, while in shear rheology, the interfacial area remains constant and the interface is sheared to measure the surface stress present. In this section, we will focus on the theory behind interfacial shear rheology.



The equations used in interfacial shear rheology are similar to those used in dilatational interfacial rheology, but the shear modulus is often marked with G instead of E. This is because in a general case, G and E are not equal. The shear modulus, G, represents the resistance of the interface to shear deformation, while the dilatational modulus, E, represents the resistance to area change.



Since interfacial rheological properties are relatively weak, it poses challenges for the measurement equipment. For high sensitivity, it is essential to maximize the contribution of the interface while minimizing the contribution of the bulk phase. The Boussinesq number, Bo, depicts how sensitive a measurement method is for detecting the interfacial viscoelasticity. A higher Boussinesq number indicates a more sensitive measurement method.



The commercialized measurement techniques for interfacial shear rheology include the magnetic needle method, rotating ring method, and rotating bicone method. The magnetic needle method, developed by Brooks et al., has the highest Boussinesq number of the commercialized methods. In this method, a thin magnetic needle is oscillated at the interface using a magnetic field. By following the movement of the needle with a camera, the viscoelastic properties of the interface can be detected. This method is often used in combination with a Langmuir trough in order to conduct experiments as a function of the packing density of the molecules or particles.



In summary, interfacial rheology is a crucial tool in understanding the mechanical properties of interfaces. By studying the response of the adsorbed interfacial layer to deformation, we can gain insights into the stability and behavior of interfaces in various applications. In the next section, we will explore the different types of interfaces and the forces that govern their behavior.

Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that lines the alveoli in the lungs and reduces surface tension to prevent alveolar collapse. Meibum is a lipid layer that covers the surface of the eye and helps to maintain a stable tear film.



In conclusion, interfacial rheology is a vital tool for understanding and controlling the behavior of interfaces in various applications.

## Chapter 17: Interfacial Transport:



### Section: 17.1 Interfacial Transport Theory:



### Subsection (optional): 17.1a Introduction to Interfacial Transport



Interfacial transport is a crucial aspect of interfacial phenomena, which deals with the behavior and interactions of interfaces between different phases of matter. In this chapter, we will explore the various mechanisms and processes involved in interfacial transport, including diffusion, convection, and migration. We will also discuss the factors that influence interfacial transport, such as surface tension, interfacial energy, and intermolecular forces. Understanding interfacial transport is crucial in many fields, including materials science, chemical engineering, and biophysics, as it plays a significant role in the behavior and properties of materials at the interface.



Interfacial energy, as discussed in the previous chapter, is a key factor in determining the behavior of interfaces. It is defined as the energy required to create a unit area of interface between two phases. This energy is influenced by the atomic arrangement and bonding at the interface, which in turn affects the intermolecular forces between the two phases. The interfacial energy can also be altered by the presence of impurities or alloying elements, as they can cause segregation at the interface and modify the atomic arrangement.



One of the primary mechanisms of interfacial transport is diffusion, which is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Diffusion plays a crucial role in many processes, such as mass transfer, heat transfer, and chemical reactions. In interfacial transport, diffusion occurs across the interface between two phases, and the rate of diffusion is influenced by the interfacial energy. Higher interfacial energy barriers can impede the diffusion of particles, while lower interfacial energy can promote diffusion.



Convection is another mechanism of interfacial transport, which involves the movement of particles due to the bulk flow of a fluid. This can occur at the interface between two immiscible fluids, such as oil and water, where the interface acts as a barrier to the flow of the fluids. The interfacial energy and surface tension play a crucial role in determining the behavior of the interface and the resulting convective flow.



Migration is a process that involves the movement of particles or defects within a material. This can occur at interfaces, where the interfacial energy can influence the migration of particles or defects. For example, in grain boundaries, the interfacial energy can affect the mechanisms of grain boundary sliding and dislocation transmission. Higher interfacial energy barriers can impede the movement of particles or defects, resulting in stronger grain boundaries and enhanced mechanical properties.



In addition to these mechanisms, the orientation of grain boundaries also plays a significant role in interfacial transport. High-angle grain boundaries, which have large misorientations between adjacent grains, tend to have higher interfacial energy and are more effective in impeding dislocation motion. In contrast, low-angle grain boundaries with small misorientations and lower interfacial energy may allow for easier dislocation transmission and exhibit weaker grain boundary strengthening effects.



Grain boundary engineering is a technique used to manipulate the grain boundary structure and energy to enhance mechanical properties. By controlling the interfacial energy, it is possible to engineer materials with desirable grain boundary characteristics, such as increased interfacial area, higher grain boundary density, or specific grain boundary types. This technique has been successfully applied in various materials, such as metals, ceramics, and polymers, to improve their mechanical properties.



In conclusion, interfacial transport is a crucial aspect of interfacial phenomena, and understanding its mechanisms and influencing factors is essential in various fields. In this chapter, we have provided a comprehensive guide to interfacial transport, covering its various aspects and applications. By understanding interfacial transport, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior and properties of materials at the interface, and use this knowledge to engineer materials with enhanced performance.

### Subsection (optional): 17.1b Interfacial Transport Phenomena



In the previous section, we discussed the importance of interfacial energy in determining the behavior of interfaces. In this section, we will delve deeper into the various interfacial transport phenomena that occur at the interface between two phases.



Interfacial transport can be broadly classified into three main mechanisms: diffusion, convection, and migration. Diffusion, as mentioned before, is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This process is driven by the concentration gradient and is influenced by the interfacial energy. Higher interfacial energy barriers can impede the diffusion of particles, while lower interfacial energy can promote diffusion.



Convection, on the other hand, involves the bulk movement of fluids due to a temperature or concentration gradient. This mechanism is particularly important in interfacial transport as it can significantly enhance the rate of mass transfer. Convection can occur in both liquid and gas phases and is influenced by factors such as surface tension, viscosity, and density differences between the two phases.



The third mechanism of interfacial transport is migration, which involves the movement of particles or molecules across the interface due to an external electric or magnetic field. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in electrochemistry and can be used to control the transport of ions and molecules at the interface.



In addition to these three main mechanisms, there are also other factors that can influence interfacial transport. These include surface roughness, intermolecular forces, and the presence of impurities or alloying elements. Surface roughness can affect the diffusion of particles by providing additional surface area for them to interact with. Intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces, can also play a significant role in interfacial transport by influencing the interactions between particles at the interface.



In conclusion, interfacial transport is a complex phenomenon that involves the movement of particles, fluids, and molecules at the interface between two phases. Understanding these mechanisms and the factors that influence them is crucial in many fields, including materials science, chemical engineering, and biophysics. In the next section, we will explore the applications of interfacial transport in various industries and research areas.

Graphene has been shown to have excellent water-repelling properties, making it a promising material for use in waterproof devices. By incorporating graphene into the chassis of devices, it may be possible to create a new generation of waterproof devices that do not require traditional sealing methods.



Interfacial transport can also be utilized in grain boundary strengthening.

## Chapter 19: Interfacial Phenomena in Multiphase Systems



### Section: 19.1 Multiphase System Theory



### Subsection: 19.1a Introduction to Multiphase Systems



Multiphase systems are systems that consist of multiple phases or states of matter. These phases can include solids, liquids, and gases, and they can exist in various combinations and configurations. In this section, we will introduce the basic concepts and theories related to multiphase systems.



One of the key theories in understanding multiphase systems is the concept of relative permeability. Relative permeability is a measure of the ability of a fluid phase to flow through a porous medium, relative to the flow of another fluid phase. In multiphase systems, the relative permeability curves of each fluid phase can be averaged to determine the overall permeability of the system. This is important in understanding the flow of fluids in porous media, such as in oil reservoirs or groundwater systems.



Another important aspect of multiphase systems is thermal energy storage. This refers to the ability of a system to store and release thermal energy. In multiphase systems, this can occur through various mechanisms, such as phase changes or chemical reactions. One example of this is hot silicon technology, where thermal energy is stored in the form of heat in silicon and can be released when needed.



To understand the behavior of multiphase systems, we must also consider the equations for heat transfer and entropy production. The general equation for heat transfer takes into account the flow of heat, as well as the effects of temperature, pressure, and entropy. The equation for entropy production, on the other hand, describes the rate at which entropy is produced in a system. This is important in understanding the efficiency and stability of multiphase systems.



In the case of ideal fluid flow, where thermal conduction and viscous forces are absent, the equation for entropy production simplifies to zero. This shows that ideal fluid flow is isentropic, meaning that there is no change in entropy during the flow process. This is a fundamental concept in understanding the behavior of multiphase systems.



In conclusion, multiphase systems are complex and dynamic systems that require a comprehensive understanding of various theories and concepts. In the following sections, we will explore the different interfacial phenomena that can occur in these systems and their implications in various applications and processes.

Surfactants, or surface-active agents, are compounds that lower the surface tension between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid. They are commonly used in cleaning products such as detergents, soaps, and shampoos. The interfacial properties of surfactants play a crucial role in their effectiveness in removing dirt and oils from surfaces.



In the cleaning process, surfactants form micelles, which are spherical structures with a hydrophobic (water-repelling) core and a hydrophilic (water-attracting) outer layer. The hydrophobic core of the micelle attracts and surrounds dirt and oils, while the hydrophilic outer layer allows the micelle to be washed away with water. This process is known as emulsification and is essential in removing dirt and oils from surfaces.



Understanding the interfacial properties of surfactants is crucial in formulating effective cleaning products. By manipulating the structure and composition of surfactants, manufacturers can create products that are better suited for specific cleaning tasks, such as removing grease or stains.

Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a process used to extract additional oil from reservoirs after primary and secondary recovery methods have been exhausted. One method of EOR is the injection of surfactants and polymers into the reservoir to reduce the interfacial tension between the oil and water phases. This reduction in interfacial tension allows the oil to flow more easily through the porous rock and be extracted.



The interfacial tension between oil and water can also be manipulated by changing the salinity of the injected water. This method, known as low-salinity waterflooding, has been shown to improve oil recovery by altering the wettability of the rock surface and reducing the interfacial tension between the oil and water phases.



By understanding and manipulating interfacial tension, engineers can optimize the EOR process and increase the amount of oil that can be extracted from a reservoir.
