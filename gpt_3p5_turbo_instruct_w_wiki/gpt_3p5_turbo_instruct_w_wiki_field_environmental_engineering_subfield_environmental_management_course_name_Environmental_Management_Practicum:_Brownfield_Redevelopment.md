## Foreward



Welcome to "Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment". This book serves as a comprehensive guide for students and professionals alike who are interested in the complex and challenging field of brownfield redevelopment. As the title suggests, this book focuses on the practical aspects of environmental management in the context of brownfield sites.



Brownfield sites, as defined by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, are abandoned or underutilized properties that may be contaminated with hazardous substances. These sites pose a significant challenge for landowners, as they are responsible for conducting an "all appropriate inquiry" to determine the extent of contamination and take necessary steps to protect human health and the environment.



The Act also provides funding for brownfield revitalization, with $250 million per year allocated for assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training. This funding is crucial in facilitating the redevelopment of brownfield sites, which often require significant financial resources.



Through public-private partnerships and collaborations with various agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Program has been successful in turning dilapidated properties into viable economic developments or green spaces. This book will explore the various aspects of this process, including funding criteria, community involvement, and the role of urban green spaces in brownfield redevelopment.



We have also included a case study on the redevelopment of brownfield sites in Canada, providing a real-world example of the challenges and successes in this field.



We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in environmental management and brownfield redevelopment. We would like to thank the authors for their contributions and hope that this book will inspire future research and innovation in this important area.

However, this form of private enforcement was limited and inadequate in dealing with major environmental threats, particularly those affecting common resources.



As industrialization and urbanization increased in the 19th and 20th centuries, the need for more comprehensive environmental laws became apparent. The "Great Stink" of 1858 in London, caused by the dumping of sewerage into the River Thames, led to the passing of the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848 and the construction of the London sewerage system. Similarly, the "Great Smog" of 1952 in London, caused by air pollution, triggered the Clean Air Act 1956. These events highlighted the need for government intervention and regulation to protect the environment and public health.



Today, environmental laws cover a wide range of issues, including air and water pollution, waste management, biodiversity conservation, and climate change. In the United States, the primary federal environmental laws include the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). These laws are enforced by agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Justice.



In addition to federal laws, there are also state and local environmental laws that may apply to brownfield redevelopment projects. These laws may vary depending on the location and may include regulations for land use, zoning, and environmental impact assessments. It is important for environmental managers to be familiar with all applicable laws and regulations to ensure compliance and successful brownfield redevelopment.



Overall, environmental laws play a crucial role in protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, they provide the legal framework for addressing environmental contamination and ensuring that the site is remediated in a safe and sustainable manner.

One of the most significant pieces of environmental legislation in the United States is the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund Act. This law was enacted in 1980 to address the cleanup of hazardous waste sites, including brownfields. CERCLA provides the legal authority and funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to clean up contaminated sites and hold responsible parties accountable for the costs of remediation.



Another important federal law is the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which was passed in 1976. RCRA regulates the management of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, including the disposal of hazardous waste on brownfield sites. It also requires the proper handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste to prevent harm to human health and the environment.



In addition to these federal laws, there are also state and local environmental laws that may apply to brownfield redevelopment. For example, many states have their own versions of CERCLA, known as state Superfund laws, which may have different requirements and regulations. Local zoning and land use laws may also impact brownfield redevelopment projects, as they dictate how land can be used and developed.



Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are another important aspect of environmental legislation. These assessments are required by federal and state laws to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project, including brownfield redevelopment. EIAs consider factors such as air and water quality, wildlife habitats, and potential contamination to determine the potential environmental impacts of a project and identify ways to mitigate or avoid these impacts.



Overall, environmental legislation plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment by providing the legal framework for addressing environmental issues and promoting sustainable development. It is important for environmental management practitioners to be familiar with these laws and regulations to ensure compliance and successful project outcomes. In the following sections, we will explore some of these laws in more detail and discuss their implications for brownfield redevelopment.

Brownfield redevelopment is the process of revitalizing contaminated or underutilized land for new development. This practice not only improves the economic value of the land, but also addresses environmental concerns and promotes sustainable development. In this section, we will explore the definition and overview of brownfield redevelopment, including its history, current practices, and future trends.



### Subsection: 2.1a Definition of Brownfield



The definition of brownfield land varies and is decided by policy makers and/or land developers within different countries. Generally, brownfield land refers to land that is abandoned or underutilized due to pollution from industrial use. The main difference in definitions of whether a piece of land is considered a brownfield or not depends on the presence or absence of pollution.



In Canada, the Federal Government defines brownfields as "abandoned, idle or underutilized commercial or industrial properties [typically located in urban areas] where past actions have caused environmental contamination, but which still have potential for redevelopment or other economic opportunities." This definition highlights the potential for economic opportunities and redevelopment of brownfield sites, while also acknowledging the presence of environmental contamination.



In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines brownfield not simply as a possible improvement site which has been previously improved, but one that may also have impediments, such as "the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant". This definition aligns with the general scope of the term, which includes "industrial or commercial property."



The term "brownfields" first gained widespread use in the United States in the 1990s, when the EPA launched the Brownfields Program to provide grants and technical assistance for the assessment and cleanup of brownfield sites. Since then, the term has been adopted by other countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, to refer to similar types of contaminated or underutilized land.

## Chapter 3: Site Assessment and Remediation



### Section 3.1: Site Assessment



Site assessment is a crucial step in the process of brownfield redevelopment. It involves the collection and analysis of data to identify potential contaminants and assess the level of risk they pose to public health and the environment. This section will discuss the purpose of site assessment and the initial steps involved in the process.



#### 3.1a: Purpose of Site Assessment



The purpose of site assessment is to gather information about the history and current condition of a brownfield site in order to identify potential contaminants and assess the level of risk they pose. This information is used to develop a conceptual site model, which is a visual representation of the site and its potential sources of contamination. The conceptual site model is an important tool in the decision-making process for remediation.



Site assessment also involves engaging stakeholders and the community in the process. This is important for several reasons. First, it allows for the exchange of information and concerns between all parties involved. Second, it promotes transparency and builds trust between the developer and the community. Finally, involving stakeholders and the community can lead to a more comprehensive and effective site assessment.



The initial steps of site assessment include the collection and analysis of historical data and a site reconnaissance. Historical data can include records of past land use, previous environmental assessments, and any known contamination incidents. This information can provide valuable insight into potential sources of contamination and help guide the site assessment process.



A site reconnaissance involves physically inspecting the site and its surroundings to identify any visible signs of contamination, such as discolored soil or unusual odors. This step is important because it can help identify potential areas of concern and guide the selection of sampling locations.



#### 3.1b: Data Collection and Analysis



Data collection and analysis is a critical component of site assessment. It involves gathering information about the site's history, geology, hydrology, and potential sources of contamination. This data is then analyzed to determine the extent and severity of contamination and to develop a remediation plan.



One of the key tools used in data collection and analysis is the soil inference system (SINFERS). This system uses pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to infer soil properties based on known data. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the site's contamination levels and potential risks.



Other tools and techniques used in site assessment include geophysical surveys, which use instruments to detect subsurface anomalies, and remote sensing, which uses satellite imagery to identify potential areas of concern. These methods can provide valuable information about the site without the need for invasive sampling.



#### 3.1c: Tools and Techniques for Site Assessment



In addition to the tools and techniques mentioned above, there are several other methods that can be used for site assessment. These include:



- Groundwater monitoring: This involves collecting and analyzing samples of groundwater to determine the presence and concentration of contaminants.

- Soil sampling and analysis: Soil samples can be collected and analyzed to determine the type and concentration of contaminants present.

- Air monitoring: This involves measuring the levels of airborne contaminants at the site.

- Ecological surveys: These surveys assess the impact of contamination on the surrounding environment and wildlife.



The choice of tools and techniques used in site assessment will depend on the specific site and its characteristics. It is important to use a combination of methods to gather a comprehensive understanding of the site's contamination levels and potential risks.



In the next section, we will discuss the process of remediation and how the information gathered during site assessment is used to develop a remediation plan. 





## Chapter 3: Site Assessment and Remediation



### Section 3.2: Remediation Techniques



Remediation techniques are essential for the successful redevelopment of brownfield sites. These techniques can be broadly categorized into ex-situ and in-situ methods. Ex-situ methods involve the excavation and treatment of contaminated soils and groundwater at the surface, while in-situ methods aim to treat the contamination without removing the soils or groundwater. In this section, we will provide an overview of the various remediation techniques commonly used in brownfield redevelopment.



#### 3.2a: Overview of Remediation Techniques



One of the most commonly used remediation techniques is thermal desorption. This technology involves the use of a desorber to volatilize contaminants, such as oil, mercury, or hydrocarbons, from soil or sludge. The contaminants can then be collected or destroyed in an offgas treatment system. Thermal desorption is particularly effective for treating volatile organic compounds (VOCs).



Another ex-situ method is excavation or dredging, which involves the removal of contaminated soil or sediment from a site. The excavated material can then be disposed of in a regulated landfill or treated on-site using bioaugmentation or biostimulation techniques. These techniques have proven to be effective in remediating semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs).



In-situ remediation techniques include solidification and stabilization, soil vapor extraction, permeable reactive barriers, monitored natural attenuation, bioremediation-phytoremediation, chemical oxidation, steam-enhanced extraction, and in situ thermal desorption. These methods have been extensively used in the USA and have shown promising results in treating various contaminants.



Solidification and stabilization involve the addition of materials, such as cement or lime, to contaminated soil to immobilize the contaminants and reduce their mobility. Soil vapor extraction, on the other hand, involves the use of a vacuum to extract volatile contaminants from the soil. Permeable reactive barriers use reactive materials, such as zero-valent iron, to treat contaminants as they pass through the barrier.



Monitored natural attenuation is a passive remediation technique that relies on natural processes, such as biodegradation, to reduce contaminant concentrations over time. Bioremediation-phytoremediation involves the use of microorganisms or plants to degrade or absorb contaminants, respectively. Chemical oxidation uses oxidizing agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, to break down contaminants into less harmful substances.



Steam-enhanced extraction involves injecting steam into the soil to increase the volatility of contaminants, making them easier to extract. In situ thermal desorption, as mentioned earlier, involves heating the soil to volatilize contaminants for collection or destruction. These in-situ techniques are often preferred as they minimize disturbance to the site and can be more cost-effective.



In recent years, ex-situ chemical oxidation has also been utilized in the remediation of contaminated soil. This process involves the use of chemical oxidants, such as ozone or persulfate, to break down contaminants into less harmful substances. This technique has shown promising results in treating a wide range of contaminants.



Overall, the selection of a remediation technique will depend on various factors, including the type and extent of contamination, site conditions, and cost. It is important to carefully evaluate and compare different techniques to determine the most suitable and effective approach for each brownfield site. 





### Biological treatment technologies



#### Bioaugmentation



Bioaugmentation is a commonly used technique in bioremediation, which involves the addition of specific microorganisms to a contaminated site to enhance the degradation of pollutants. This process increases the reactive enzyme concentration within the bioremediation system and subsequently may increase contaminant degradation rates over the nonaugmented rates, at least initially after inoculation. Bioaugmentation is particularly effective in treating contaminants that are difficult to degrade, such as chlorinated solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons.



One of the key advantages of bioaugmentation is its ability to target specific contaminants, making it a more efficient and cost-effective remediation technique compared to other methods. However, the success of bioaugmentation depends on several factors, including the selection of appropriate microorganisms, their compatibility with the site conditions, and the availability of nutrients and electron acceptors.



#### Bioventing



Bioventing is an in-situ remediation technique that utilizes microorganisms to biodegrade organic constituents in the groundwater system. This technique enhances the activity of indigenous bacteria and archaea and stimulates the natural in situ biodegradation of hydrocarbons by inducing air or oxygen flow into the unsaturated zone and, if necessary, by adding nutrients. During bioventing, oxygen may be supplied through direct air injection into residual contamination in soil.



Bioventing is particularly effective in treating volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). It has been extensively used in the USA and has shown promising results in treating various contaminants. However, the success of bioventing depends on several factors, including the type and concentration of contaminants, the availability of oxygen and nutrients, and the site's hydrogeological conditions.



### Chemical treatment technologies



#### Chemical oxidation



Chemical oxidation is an ex-situ remediation technique that involves the use of chemical oxidants to degrade contaminants in soil and groundwater. This technique is particularly effective in treating organic compounds, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents, and pesticides. Some commonly used chemical oxidants include ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and permanganate.



Chemical oxidation works by breaking down the contaminants into less harmful substances through oxidation reactions. The success of this technique depends on several factors, including the type and concentration of contaminants, the choice of oxidant, and the site's hydrogeological conditions. Chemical oxidation is often used in combination with other remediation techniques, such as bioremediation, to achieve better results.



#### Nanoremediation



Nanoremediation is a relatively new technique that involves the use of nanomaterials to remediate contaminated sites. These nanomaterials, such as zero-valent iron and carbon nanotubes, have a high surface area and reactivity, making them effective in degrading contaminants. Nanoremediation can be used for both in-situ and ex-situ remediation and has shown promising results in treating a wide range of contaminants, including heavy metals, chlorinated solvents, and petroleum hydrocarbons.



However, the use of nanomaterials in remediation is still in its early stages, and more research is needed to fully understand their potential risks and benefits. Additionally, the high cost of nanomaterials and the lack of regulations for their use in remediation may limit their widespread application.



### Physical treatment technologies



#### Pump and treat



Pump and treat is an ex-situ remediation technique that involves the extraction of contaminated groundwater through a series of wells, followed by treatment and reinjection of the treated water back into the aquifer. This technique is particularly effective in treating groundwater contaminated with organic compounds, such as petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents.



Pump and treat is a well-established remediation technique and has been used for decades. However, it can be a slow and costly process, especially for large and complex sites. Additionally, it may not be suitable for treating contaminants that are difficult to remove, such as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs).



#### Air sparging



Air sparging is an in-situ remediation technique that involves the injection of air into the saturated zone of a contaminated site to enhance the natural biodegradation of contaminants. This technique is particularly effective in treating volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and has been extensively used in the USA.



Air sparging works by increasing the oxygen levels in the groundwater, which stimulates the growth of aerobic microorganisms that can degrade contaminants. However, the success of this technique depends on several factors, including the type and concentration of contaminants, the site's hydrogeological conditions, and the availability of nutrients.



### Conclusion



In this section, we have provided an overview of some of the commonly used remediation techniques in brownfield redevelopment. These techniques can be broadly categorized into biological, chemical, and physical methods, each with its own advantages and limitations. The selection of the appropriate remediation technique depends on several factors, including the type and concentration of contaminants, the site's hydrogeological conditions, and the project's budget and timeline. It is crucial to carefully evaluate these factors before deciding on the most suitable remediation approach for a brownfield site.





### Section: 3.2 Remediation Techniques:



#### 3.2c Case Studies in Remediation



In this section, we will explore two case studies of successful remediation using permeable reactive barriers (PRBs). PRBs are a type of in-situ remediation technique that utilizes reactive media to treat contaminated groundwater. The reactive media, typically granular iron or zero-valent iron, creates a permeable treatment zone that allows for the passive removal of contaminants as groundwater flows through it.



#### Sunnyvale, CA



The first field-scale implementation of PRB was in Sunnyvale, California, at the site of a previously operating semi-conductor plant. The site was contaminated with chlorinated ethylenes, specifically PCE and TCE, which are commonly used in industrial processes. At the time, the best available remediation technology was pump and treat, which involves pumping contaminated groundwater to the surface for treatment. However, this method was costly and time-consuming.



PRBs presented a more cost-effective solution to the problem at hand, being able to passively remediate the groundwater. Granular iron was chosen as the reactive media after laboratory testing using contaminated water from the site. After installation, contaminants were reduced to target levels. As a result, the pump and treat machinery was able to be removed, and the above ground was free to be used for commercial purposes. The savings from using the PRB as opposed to pump and treat were able to pay for the installation in about three years.



#### Elizabeth City, NC



In 1996, a 46 m long, 7.3 m deep, 0.6 m thick PRB was installed at a Coast Guard Facility near Elizabeth City, NC. The goal of this PRB was to remediate a contaminant plume of trichloroethylene (TCE) and hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)). The PRB took only 6 hours to install using a continuous trenching technique, which simultaneously removed the pre-existing sediment while installing the reactive medium (granular iron).



The PRB was configured as a continuous wall as opposed to a funnel-and-gate setup because 3D computer simulations suggested that the two would have the same effectiveness, but cost analyses showed that the continuous setup would be cheaper to install. The treatment zone was designed to intercept the contaminant plume and create a barrier to prevent further migration.



The results of this PRB were successful, with the contaminants being reduced to target levels. The continuous wall design proved to be effective and cost-efficient, making it a viable option for future PRB installations.



In conclusion, these case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of PRBs in remediating contaminated sites. They offer a more cost-effective and passive solution compared to traditional methods such as pump and treat. However, the success of PRBs depends on various factors, including the selection of appropriate reactive media, site conditions, and design considerations. Further research and case studies are needed to continue improving and optimizing the use of PRBs in environmental management.





### Section: 3.3 Monitoring and Evaluation:

In order to effectively assess the success of a brownfield redevelopment project, it is important to establish clear evaluation criteria. These criteria should be based on the goals and objectives of the project, as well as any regulatory requirements or community concerns.



One key aspect of evaluation criteria is the measurement of contaminant levels. This can be done through various techniques such as soil sampling, groundwater monitoring, and air monitoring, as discussed in the previous section. The data collected from these techniques can then be compared to regulatory standards or baseline measurements to determine the effectiveness of the remediation process.



Another important aspect of evaluation criteria is the impact on human health and the environment. This can be assessed through risk assessments, which take into account the potential exposure pathways and the toxicity of the contaminants. The goal of remediation is to reduce these risks to acceptable levels, and evaluation criteria should reflect this.



In addition to these technical criteria, it is also important to consider the social and economic impacts of the brownfield redevelopment project. This can include factors such as job creation, property values, and community satisfaction. These criteria can be more subjective and may require input from stakeholders and community members.



Overall, the evaluation criteria should be comprehensive and consider all aspects of the brownfield redevelopment project. They should also be regularly reviewed and updated as the project progresses to ensure that the goals and objectives are being met. By establishing clear and measurable evaluation criteria, the success of the project can be accurately assessed and any necessary adjustments can be made.

## Chapter: Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment



### Introduction



In this chapter, we will be discussing the financing aspect of brownfield redevelopment. Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that are potentially contaminated with hazardous substances. These properties often pose a threat to public health and the environment, and their redevelopment can bring numerous benefits to the community. However, the cost of cleaning up and redeveloping brownfields can be a major barrier for developers and investors. Therefore, understanding the various financing options available for brownfield redevelopment is crucial for successful and sustainable projects.



We will begin by discussing the different types of brownfield financing, including public and private funding sources. Public funding sources include grants, loans, and tax incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. Private funding sources, on the other hand, include traditional financing options such as bank loans and equity investments. We will also explore the advantages and limitations of each type of financing and how they can be combined to create a comprehensive funding package for brownfield redevelopment.



Furthermore, we will delve into the process of securing financing for brownfield projects. This includes identifying potential funding sources, understanding their requirements and application processes, and developing a strong financing proposal. We will also discuss the importance of community involvement and support in securing financing for brownfield redevelopment.



Finally, we will examine case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects and how they were financed. These real-world examples will provide valuable insights and lessons learned for future brownfield redevelopment projects. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the financing aspect of brownfield redevelopment and be equipped with the knowledge and tools to successfully finance their own projects.





### Section: 6.1 Overview of Financing Options:



Brownfield redevelopment projects can be costly and complex, making it challenging for developers and investors to secure the necessary funds. In this section, we will provide an overview of the different financing options available for brownfield redevelopment, including public and private funding sources.



#### 6.1a Public Financing Options



Public financing options for brownfield redevelopment include grants, loans, and tax incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. These funding sources are crucial in supporting the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites, as they can help offset the high costs associated with these projects.



One of the main public financing options for brownfield redevelopment is through grants. These grants are typically provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies, as well as state and local governments. They can cover a portion of the costs for site assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment, making it more feasible for developers and investors to take on these projects.



Another public financing option is through loans. The EPA offers low-interest loans through its Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program, which provides funding for the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites. These loans can be used to cover a variety of costs, including site assessment, remediation, and even construction.



In addition to grants and loans, tax incentives are also available for brownfield redevelopment. These incentives can come in the form of tax credits, exemptions, or deductions, and are designed to encourage private investment in brownfield sites. For example, the federal Brownfields Tax Incentive allows developers to deduct the costs of environmental cleanup from their taxes, making it more financially viable to take on these projects.



While public financing options can provide significant support for brownfield redevelopment, they also have their limitations. For instance, grants and loans may have strict eligibility requirements and application processes, making it challenging for some projects to qualify. Tax incentives may also have limitations, such as only being available for certain types of brownfield sites or requiring a minimum level of investment.



To overcome these limitations, it is common for developers and investors to combine multiple public financing sources to create a comprehensive funding package for brownfield redevelopment. This can involve leveraging grants, loans, and tax incentives from different levels of government to cover a larger portion of the costs.



In the next section, we will explore private financing options for brownfield redevelopment and how they can be combined with public funding sources to support these projects.





### Section: 6.1 Overview of Financing Options:



Brownfield redevelopment projects can be costly and complex, making it challenging for developers and investors to secure the necessary funds. In this section, we will provide an overview of the different financing options available for brownfield redevelopment, including public and private funding sources.



#### 6.1a Public Financing Options



Public financing options for brownfield redevelopment include grants, loans, and tax incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. These funding sources are crucial in supporting the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites, as they can help offset the high costs associated with these projects.



One of the main public financing options for brownfield redevelopment is through grants.

The EPA offers low-interest loans through its Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program, which provides funding for the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites. These loans can be used to cover a variety of costs, including site assessment, remediation, and even construction.



In addition to grants and loans, tax incentives are also available for brownfield redevelopment. These incentives can come in the form of tax credits, exemptions, or deductions, and are designed to encourage private investment in brownfield sites. For example, the federal Brownfields Tax Incentive allows developers to deduct the costs of environmental cleanup from their taxes, making it more financially viable to take on these projects.



While public financing options can provide significant support for brownfield redevelopment, they also have their limitations. Grants and loans are often competitive and may not cover all of the costs associated with a project. Additionally, tax incentives may not be enough to offset the high costs of remediation and redevelopment. This is where private financing options come into play.



### Subsection: 6.1b Private Financing Options



Private financing options for brownfield redevelopment involve obtaining funds from private investors or lenders. These options can provide developers and investors with more flexibility and control over the terms of the financing, but they also come with their own set of risks and challenges.



#### Direct Mortgage Investment



One form of private financing for brownfield redevelopment is through direct mortgage investment. This involves a single investor (lender) providing a loan to the borrower and securing it with a registered mortgage on the property. The borrower makes monthly payments directly to the lender, and there may be a broker involved in the initial introduction, but the lender works directly with the borrower after the loan is funded.



Direct mortgage investment has been a traditional method for investors to extend loans to borrowers for hundreds of years. It offers simplicity and transparency, as the lender has full control over the terms of the loan. However, this also means that the investment is not diversified, and if the borrower fails to make payments, the income flow to the lender stops.



#### Fractional Investment



Another private financing option for brownfield redevelopment is through fractional investment. This involves multiple investors pooling their funds to provide a loan to the borrower. A limited number of investors (usually 10 in California) secure the loan by placing their names on a deed of trust on the property. A servicing agent then distributes the monthly payments pro rata to the individual investors.



Fractional investment offers the benefits of simplicity and transparency, as each investor has the opportunity to review the loan before making a decision to invest. However, it can be time-consuming to build each loan investor-by-investor, which may detract from the speed advantage of private financing. Additionally, the investment is not diversified, and if the borrower fails to make payments, the income flow to the investors stops.



#### Mortgage Fund Investment



The third form of private financing for brownfield redevelopment is through mortgage fund investment. This involves investors pooling their funds into a mortgage fund, which is then used to provide loans to borrowers. The fund is managed by a professional fund manager, who makes all investment decisions on behalf of the investors.



Mortgage fund investment offers the benefits of diversification and professional management, but it also comes with higher fees and less control for individual investors. Additionally, the fund manager may have different investment goals and risk tolerance than individual investors, which could lead to conflicts of interest.



In conclusion, private financing options for brownfield redevelopment can provide developers and investors with more flexibility and control over the terms of the financing. However, they also come with their own set of risks and challenges, and it is important to carefully consider all options before making a decision. In the next section, we will discuss the role of public-private partnerships in financing brownfield redevelopment projects.





### Section: 6.1 Overview of Financing Options:



Brownfield redevelopment projects can be costly and complex, making it challenging for developers and investors to secure the necessary funds. In this section, we will provide an overview of the different financing options available for brownfield redevelopment, including public and private funding sources.

Public financing options for brownfield redevelopment include grants, loans, and tax incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. These funding sources are crucial in supporting the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites, as they can help offset the high costs associated with these projects.



One of the main public financing options for brownfield redevelopment is through grants. These grants are typically provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies, as well as state and local governments. They can cover a portion of the costs for site assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment, making it more feasible for developers and investors to take on these projects.



Another public financing option is through loans. The EPA offers low-interest loans through its Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program, which provides funding for the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites. These loans can be used to cover a variety of costs, including site assessment, remediation, and even construction.



In addition to grants and loans, tax incentives are also available for brownfield redevelopment. These incentives can come in the form of tax credits, exemptions, or deductions, and are designed to encourage private investment in brownfield sites. For example, the federal Brownfields Tax Incentive allows developers to deduct the costs of environmental cleanup from their taxes, making it more financially viable to take on these projects.



While public financing options can provide significant support for brownfield redevelopment, they also have their limitations. Grants and loans are often competitive and may not cover all of the costs associated with a project. Tax incentives may also have restrictions and may not be available for all types of brownfield sites. This is where public-private partnerships (PPPs) can play a crucial role in financing brownfield redevelopment.



#### 6.1b Private Financing Options



Private financing options for brownfield redevelopment include traditional bank loans, equity investments, and alternative financing methods such as crowdfunding and real estate investment trusts (REITs). These options are typically used in conjunction with public financing to cover the remaining costs of a project.



Traditional bank loans are a common source of financing for brownfield redevelopment. These loans are typically secured by the property and require a detailed business plan and financial projections. Equity investments, on the other hand, involve selling a portion of ownership in the project to investors in exchange for funding. This can be a more flexible option for developers, but it also means sharing profits with investors.



Alternative financing methods, such as crowdfunding and REITs, have become increasingly popular in recent years. Crowdfunding involves raising small amounts of money from a large number of individuals through online platforms. REITs, on the other hand, are companies that own and operate income-generating real estate properties, including brownfield sites. Both of these options can provide a diverse pool of funding sources and may be more accessible for smaller projects.



#### 6.1c Public-Private Partnerships



Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are a collaborative approach to financing and managing public infrastructure projects, including brownfield redevelopment. PPPs involve a partnership between a public agency and a private entity, where the private entity provides financing, expertise, and resources to develop and manage the project. In return, the private entity receives a share of the project's profits.



PPPs have become increasingly popular in Europe, with nearly 1,400 deals signed in the European Union from 1990 to 2009. However, the financial crisis of 2008 led to a decline in the number of PPP deals closed. A study conducted by the European Court of Auditors found that PPPs in France, Greece, Ireland, and Spain were characterized by "widespread shortcomings and limited benefits."



Despite these challenges, PPPs have been successfully used in brownfield redevelopment projects in countries such as Greece and the Netherlands. In Greece, the Inter-Ministerial PPP Committee authorized two projects for the redevelopment of schools on the islands of Chania and Rhodes. In the Netherlands, the Netherlands Financial Sector Development Exchange (NFX) has been instrumental in stimulating financial sector development in developing countries and emerging markets.



In Poland, the government has also recognized the potential of PPPs and approved a policy for their development in 2017. This highlights the growing interest in using PPPs as a financing option for brownfield redevelopment projects.



PPPs offer several benefits for brownfield redevelopment, including access to private funding, expertise, and resources, as well as risk-sharing between the public and private sectors. However, they also have their challenges, including complex contracts and potential conflicts of interest. Therefore, it is essential for governments to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits before entering into a PPP for brownfield redevelopment.



In conclusion, there are various financing options available for brownfield redevelopment, including public and private sources. Public financing options, such as grants, loans, and tax incentives, can provide crucial support for these projects. Private financing options, such as traditional bank loans, equity investments, and alternative methods, can also play a significant role in funding brownfield redevelopment. Additionally, public-private partnerships offer a collaborative approach to financing and managing these projects, but they also come with their own set of challenges. Ultimately, a combination of these financing options may be necessary to successfully finance and complete a brownfield redevelopment project.





### Section: 6.2 Financial Feasibility Analysis:



Financial feasibility analysis is a crucial step in the process of brownfield redevelopment. It involves evaluating the financial viability of a project by analyzing its potential costs and benefits. This analysis is essential for developers and investors to make informed decisions about whether to pursue a brownfield redevelopment project.



#### 6.2a Purpose of Financial Feasibility Analysis



The purpose of financial feasibility analysis is to determine whether a brownfield redevelopment project is financially viable. This analysis takes into account the costs associated with the project, including site assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment, as well as potential revenue streams from the project. By comparing these costs and revenues, developers and investors can assess the potential profitability of the project and make informed decisions about whether to move forward with it.



One of the main goals of financial feasibility analysis is to identify potential risks and uncertainties associated with the project. This includes not only financial risks, but also environmental, regulatory, and market risks. By identifying these risks, developers and investors can develop strategies to mitigate them and increase the chances of a successful project.



Another important purpose of financial feasibility analysis is to evaluate the potential return on investment (ROI) of a brownfield redevelopment project. This involves estimating the expected cash flows from the project and calculating the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). These metrics help developers and investors determine whether the potential returns from the project are worth the initial investment.



### Subsection: 6.2b Methods of Financial Feasibility Analysis



There are several methods that can be used to conduct a financial feasibility analysis for a brownfield redevelopment project. These include discounted cash flow analysis, sensitivity analysis, and scenario analysis.



#### Discounted Cash Flow Analysis



Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is a commonly used method for evaluating the financial feasibility of a project. It involves estimating the future cash flows from the project and discounting them to their present value using a discount rate. The resulting net present value (NPV) indicates whether the project is expected to generate a positive or negative return.



#### Sensitivity Analysis



Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to assess the impact of changes in key variables on the financial feasibility of a project. This involves varying one or more variables, such as costs or revenues, and analyzing the resulting changes in the project's NPV. This helps developers and investors understand the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the project and develop strategies to mitigate them.



#### Scenario Analysis



Scenario analysis involves evaluating the financial feasibility of a project under different scenarios or assumptions. This helps developers and investors understand how changes in market conditions, regulatory requirements, or other factors may impact the project's profitability.

Additionally, the redevelopment of brownfields can also provide opportunities for the creation of green spaces, which have been shown to have positive impacts on mental and physical health.



#### Reductions in chronic disease rates



Improved access to green space is associated with reductions in cardiovascular disease symptoms, improved rates of physical activity, lower incidence of obesity, and improved respiratory health. Lower rates of cardiovascular biomarkers are associated with access to green space, showing a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk in populations living within 1 km of green space. Not only does access to urban green space reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, but increased access has also been shown to improve recovery from major adverse cardiovascular events and lower all-cause mortality. Relationships have been found between increased access to green space, improved rates of physical activity, and reduced BMI. The percentage of sedentary and moderately active persons making use of an urban park increased when access to the park was improved.



#### Reductions in mental illness rates and improvement of social cohesion



Mental illness has been a major taboo and concern in the current fast-paced world in which time to relax is undervalued. Globally, mental illness is linked to eight million deaths each year. In urban areas, limited access to green space and poor quality of green spaces available may contribute to poor mental health outcomes. However, the redevelopment of brownfield sites into green spaces can provide opportunities for relaxation and recreation, leading to improved mental well-being. Additionally, the creation of green spaces can also promote social cohesion and community engagement, which have been linked to improved mental health outcomes.



### 10.1c Case Studies in Public Health and Brownfield Redevelopment

### Section 11.1: Economic Impacts of Brownfields



Brownfield redevelopment has become an increasingly important topic in recent years as communities across the United States seek to revitalize contaminated or abandoned properties for new development. This process has significant economic impacts, both positive and negative, on the surrounding community and the overall economy. In this section, we will explore the various economic impacts of brownfield redevelopment and their implications.



#### 11.1a: Overview of Economic Impacts



The economic impacts of brownfield redevelopment can be categorized into positive and negative impacts. Positive impacts include job creation, increased property values, and improved community well-being. On the other hand, negative impacts may include increased electricity prices and potential regressive effects on low-income households.



One of the most significant positive impacts of brownfield redevelopment is job creation. The process of remediation and redevelopment requires a significant amount of labor, which can lead to the creation of new jobs in the local community. This not only benefits the individuals who are employed, but also has a ripple effect on the local economy as these workers spend their income on goods and services in the community.



Another positive impact of brownfield redevelopment is the increase in property values. By revitalizing a contaminated or abandoned property, the surrounding area becomes more desirable for development and can lead to an increase in property values. This can benefit both property owners and the local government through increased tax revenue. Additionally, as property values increase, it can attract new businesses and industries to the area, further contributing to economic growth.



Furthermore, brownfield redevelopment can also have a positive impact on community well-being. By cleaning up and redeveloping contaminated sites, the overall health and safety of the community can be improved. This can lead to a better quality of life for residents and attract new residents to the area.



On the other hand, there are also potential negative impacts of brownfield redevelopment. One of these is the potential for increased electricity prices. The process of remediation and redevelopment can be energy-intensive, leading to higher electricity costs for the community. This can have a disproportionate impact on low-income households, potentially leading to regressive effects.



#### 11.1b: Case Studies in Economic Development and Brownfield Redevelopment



To better understand the economic impacts of brownfield redevelopment, let's examine some case studies of successful projects. One example is the redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This site was contaminated with heavy metals and other pollutants from its previous use as a steel manufacturing plant. However, through a partnership between the local government, private developers, and community organizations, the site was cleaned up and redeveloped into a mixed-use development with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. This project not only created jobs and increased property values, but also revitalized the surrounding community and improved the overall economic health of the area.



Another successful case study is the redevelopment of the former Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. This site was contaminated with petroleum and other hazardous substances from its previous use as an airport. However, through a public-private partnership, the site was cleaned up and redeveloped into a sustainable community with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. This project not only created jobs and increased property values, but also improved the overall environmental sustainability of the area.



#### 11.1c: Economic Benefits of Brownfield Redevelopment



In addition to the direct economic impacts of brownfield redevelopment, there are also indirect economic benefits that should be considered. These include cost savings for construction companies and building owners, as well as the environmental benefits of repurposing existing buildings and materials rather than constructing new ones. By repurposing existing buildings, the cost of producing new materials and the associated services is reduced, leading to cost savings for all parties involved. Additionally, repurposing materials reduces waste and the environmental impact of new construction.



In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment has significant economic impacts, both positive and negative, on the surrounding community and the overall economy. By understanding these impacts and considering them in the planning and implementation of redevelopment projects, we can ensure that brownfield redevelopment is not only environmentally sustainable, but also economically beneficial for all stakeholders involved.

### Section: 11.2 Economic Development Strategies



#### 11.2a Overview of Economic Development Strategies



In order to understand the economic impacts of brownfield redevelopment, it is important to first understand the different strategies that have been used in economic development. Economic development research has identified five phases, or "waves," of economic development practice. These waves have been shaped by historical factors, economic climates, and leaders' responses to these forces, resulting in five distinct strategies that differ from their predecessors.



The first wave of economic development, known as the Growth Promotion Approach, emerged in the United States in the 1930s as a response to the Great Depression. This approach focused on industrial recruitment through financial incentives such as tax abatement and loans. The goal was to lower costs associated with land, infrastructure, and labor in order to attract businesses and stimulate economic growth. This method of business attraction became known as "smokestack-chasing."



Smokestack-chasing is rooted in the "boosterism" of small towns in early North America. In this wave, economic developers focused on attracting one major employer to the region, whether it be a factory, mine, college, or prison. The first step in smokestack-chasing was to promote the location to potential employers. Then, economic developers would provide incentives, such as cheap land or labor and lax environmental regulations, to improve the likelihood of the employer locating within the area.



However, this approach to economic development has been criticized for being haphazard and ineffective. Detractors argue that smokestack-chasing may lead to short-term job growth, but the long-term effects are often mixed. Additionally, this strategy has been accused of neglecting the potential negative impacts on the environment and surrounding community.



Despite its criticisms, smokestack-chasing remains a prevalent strategy in economic development, often operating concurrently with other waves. As we will explore in the next section, brownfield redevelopment has become an increasingly important topic in economic development, and it is often seen as a more sustainable and responsible approach to revitalizing communities and promoting economic growth.

### Section: 11.2 Economic Development Strategies



#### 11.2b Selection of Economic Development Strategies



In order to effectively redevelop brownfield sites, it is important to understand and select appropriate economic development strategies. As mentioned in the previous section, there have been five distinct waves of economic development practice, each with its own set of strategies. In this section, we will discuss the selection of economic development strategies and how they can be applied to brownfield redevelopment.



The first step in selecting economic development strategies is to assess the current economic climate and the specific needs and challenges of the community. This can be done through a thorough analysis of the local economy, including industries, employment rates, and income levels. It is also important to consider the potential impacts of brownfield redevelopment on the community, such as job creation, tax revenue, and environmental benefits.



Once the economic climate and community needs have been assessed, economic developers can then consider which strategies would be most effective in achieving their goals. One strategy that has been successful in brownfield redevelopment is the Growth Management Approach. This approach focuses on promoting sustainable economic growth by investing in existing businesses and industries, rather than solely relying on attracting new businesses. This can be achieved through initiatives such as workforce development programs, infrastructure improvements, and business retention and expansion programs.



Another strategy that has been effective in brownfield redevelopment is the Cluster Development Approach. This approach focuses on developing and supporting clusters of related industries in a specific region. By promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing among businesses in the same industry, this approach can lead to increased innovation and competitiveness. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this strategy can be applied by targeting industries that have a high demand for remediation services, such as manufacturing or transportation.



In addition to these strategies, economic developers may also consider the use of incentives to attract businesses to redevelop brownfield sites. These incentives can include tax breaks, grants, and low-interest loans. However, it is important to carefully consider the potential long-term impacts of these incentives, as they may not always lead to sustainable economic growth.



Ultimately, the selection of economic development strategies for brownfield redevelopment should be based on a thorough understanding of the local economy and community needs. By carefully considering the potential impacts and benefits of each strategy, economic developers can effectively promote sustainable economic growth while also addressing the environmental challenges of brownfield sites.





### Section: 11.2 Economic Development Strategies



#### 11.2c Case Studies in Economic Development Strategies



In addition to understanding and selecting appropriate economic development strategies, it is important to examine case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects. These case studies can provide valuable insights and lessons learned for future projects.



One such case study is the redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This site was once a thriving steel mill, but after its closure in 1995, it became a brownfield site with significant environmental contamination. The redevelopment project, led by the Bethlehem Redevelopment Authority, focused on creating a mixed-use development that would bring economic growth and job opportunities to the community.



The project utilized a combination of economic development strategies, including the Growth Management Approach and the Cluster Development Approach. The site was divided into different zones, with a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial uses. This allowed for the creation of a diverse and sustainable economy, with a focus on retaining and expanding existing businesses in the area.



The project also incorporated environmental remediation efforts, including the removal of contaminated soil and the installation of a groundwater treatment system. This not only improved the environmental quality of the site, but also made it more attractive to potential businesses and residents.



The success of the Bethlehem Steel redevelopment project can be seen in the economic impact it has had on the community. The site now houses over 2,000 employees and generates over $1 billion in economic activity annually. It has also become a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship, with the development of a business incubator and a technology center.



Another successful case study is the redevelopment of the former Ford Motor Company plant in St. Paul, Minnesota. This site was also contaminated and had been vacant for over a decade before being redeveloped. The project, led by the St. Paul Port Authority, focused on creating a sustainable and environmentally-friendly industrial park.



The project utilized a combination of economic development strategies, including the Growth Management Approach and the Sustainable Development Approach. The site was designed to be energy-efficient and incorporate green infrastructure, such as rain gardens and permeable pavement. This not only reduced the environmental impact of the site, but also attracted businesses that were committed to sustainability.



The redevelopment of the Ford Motor Company plant has had a significant economic impact on the community. The site now houses over 2,000 employees and generates over $100 million in annual economic activity. It has also become a model for sustainable industrial development, with other cities looking to replicate its success.



These case studies demonstrate the importance of understanding and selecting appropriate economic development strategies for brownfield redevelopment. They also highlight the potential for economic growth and job creation in communities that have been impacted by brownfield sites. By utilizing a combination of strategies and incorporating environmental remediation efforts, brownfield redevelopment projects can not only revitalize communities, but also create a more sustainable and resilient economy.





### Section: 11.3 Economic Development and Community Engagement:



Community engagement plays a crucial role in the success of economic development initiatives, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. As discussed in the previous section, community economic development (CED) emphasizes the active involvement of community members in all aspects of development that affect their standard of living. This approach is especially relevant in the case of brownfield redevelopment, as these projects often have a direct impact on the surrounding community.



One of the key benefits of community engagement in economic development is the promotion of local resources and opportunities. By involving community members in the decision-making process, CED initiatives can identify and utilize local resources in a way that benefits both the community and the economy. This can include the creation of new jobs, the development of local businesses, and the improvement of social conditions.



In addition, community engagement can help to address and overcome crises and challenges faced by disadvantaged communities. By actively involving community members in the planning and implementation of economic development strategies, CED initiatives can better understand and address the specific needs and concerns of the community. This can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions that benefit both the economy and the community.



Furthermore, community engagement can contribute to the capacity building of stakeholders involved in economic development. This includes not only community members, but also governments, businesses, and non-profit organizations. By promoting collaboration and participation, CED initiatives can increase the ability and desire of these stakeholders to effectively engage in economic development. This can lead to more successful and sustainable projects in the long run.



A notable example of the role of community engagement in economic development can be seen in the redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

## Chapter: Brownfield Redevelopment and Social Equity



### Introduction:



In this chapter, we will be discussing the topic of brownfield redevelopment and its relationship with social equity. Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that are potentially contaminated with hazardous substances. These properties often pose a threat to public health and the environment, and their redevelopment can have significant impacts on the surrounding community. 



The concept of social equity refers to the fair distribution of resources and opportunities among all members of a society. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, social equity is concerned with ensuring that the benefits and burdens of the redevelopment process are distributed fairly among all stakeholders, particularly those who have historically been marginalized or disadvantaged. 



In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and social equity, and discuss the challenges and opportunities that arise in this context. We will also examine the role of environmental management practitioners in promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment projects. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the importance of considering social equity in brownfield redevelopment and the strategies that can be employed to achieve it.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, social equity means ensuring that all community members, regardless of their socioeconomic status, have equal access to the benefits of the redevelopment process.



One way to promote social equity in brownfield redevelopment is through community engagement and collaboration. This involves actively involving community members in the decision-making process and considering their needs and concerns. By working closely with local organizations and residents, environmental management practitioners can ensure that the redevelopment process is inclusive and benefits all members of the community.



Another important aspect of promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment is through the provision of affordable housing. As mentioned earlier, gentrification can lead to the displacement of low-income residents. To prevent this, affordable housing should be incorporated into the redevelopment plan. This can be achieved through partnerships with affordable housing organizations and the implementation of policies that require a certain percentage of housing units to be affordable for low-income residents.



#### 12.1c Case Studies in Social Equity and Brownfield Redevelopment



To further illustrate the importance of social equity in brownfield redevelopment, let us look at two case studies: Discovery Green in Houston, Texas and the Voluntary Cleanup Program in Texas.



##### Discovery Green



In 2004, a public-private partnership was formed to create the Discovery Green Conservancy in downtown Houston, Texas. This partnership involved the Brown Foundation, the Kinder Foundation, the Wortham Foundation, the Houston Endowment, Inc., and the City of Houston. The goal was to transform an undeveloped and underused parking lot with a history of industrial occupants into a downtown city park.



One of the key aspects of this project was the focus on social equity. The Discovery Green Conservancy worked closely with local organizations and residents to ensure that the park would benefit all members of the community. This included providing access to social services, such as healthcare and education, and incorporating affordable housing into the redevelopment plan. As a result, Discovery Green has become a popular and inclusive public space that promotes social equity in the surrounding community.

In conclusion, social equity is a crucial consideration in the redevelopment of brownfields. By actively involving community members in the decision-making process and prioritizing their needs and concerns, environmental management practitioners can promote social equity and prevent the displacement of vulnerable populations. Through partnerships with local organizations and the provision of affordable housing and social services, brownfield redevelopment can have a positive impact on the surrounding community and promote social equity. 





### Section: 12.2 Social Equity Strategies:



#### 12.2a Overview of Social Equity Strategies



Social equity is a critical aspect of brownfield redevelopment that must be carefully considered by environmental management practitioners. It refers to the fair distribution of resources, opportunities, and benefits among all members of a community, regardless of their race, ethnicity, income, or other social factors. In this section, we will discuss some strategies that can promote social equity in the brownfield redevelopment process.



One of the key strategies for promoting social equity is community engagement. This involves actively involving community members in the decision-making process and considering their needs and concerns. Environmental management practitioners should collaborate with local organizations and community leaders to ensure that the redevelopment plans align with the community's goals and priorities. This can help to prevent the displacement of vulnerable populations and promote a sense of ownership and inclusivity within the community.



Another important strategy is the provision of affordable housing. As mentioned earlier, brownfield redevelopment can lead to gentrification and displacement of low-income residents. To address this issue, environmental management practitioners should work with developers to incorporate affordable housing units into the redevelopment plans. This can help to maintain the diversity and social fabric of the community and prevent the exclusion of marginalized populations.



In addition to affordable housing, access to social services is also crucial for promoting social equity. As the quality of life in the surrounding community can be affected by brownfield redevelopment, it is important to consider the provision of healthcare, education, and other essential services. This can be achieved through partnerships with local service providers and the implementation of programs that provide access to these services for community members.



Furthermore, environmental management practitioners should also prioritize job creation and training programs for local residents. This can help to address the issue of unemployment and promote economic opportunities for community members. Additionally, it is important to ensure that these job opportunities are accessible to all members of the community, regardless of their background or social status.



Lastly, it is crucial to address any potential biases or discrimination in the brownfield redevelopment process. This can be achieved through bias training for all stakeholders involved in the redevelopment, including students, managers, and faculty. By promoting awareness and understanding of implicit biases, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable redevelopment process.



In conclusion, social equity is a vital aspect of brownfield redevelopment that must be carefully considered and prioritized by environmental management practitioners. By implementing strategies such as community engagement, affordable housing, access to social services, job creation, and bias training, we can promote a more equitable and inclusive redevelopment process that benefits all members of the community. 





### Section: 12.2 Social Equity Strategies:



#### 12.2b Selection of Social Equity Strategies



When it comes to selecting social equity strategies for brownfield redevelopment, environmental management practitioners must consider the unique needs and challenges of each community. This requires a thorough understanding of the community's demographics, history, and current social dynamics.



One approach to selecting social equity strategies is through a participatory process. This involves actively engaging community members in the decision-making process and allowing them to have a say in the selection of strategies. This not only ensures that the strategies align with the community's needs and priorities, but also promotes a sense of ownership and empowerment within the community.



Another important factor to consider is the availability of resources. Some social equity strategies, such as affordable housing and access to social services, may require significant financial investments. Environmental management practitioners must carefully assess the resources available and work with stakeholders to secure additional funding if needed.

## Chapter: Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment



### Introduction:



In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the impact of industrialization and urbanization on the environment. As a result, there has been a push towards sustainable development and the remediation of contaminated sites, known as brownfields. Brownfield redevelopment is the process of revitalizing and reusing abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances. This chapter will focus on the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and environmental justice, exploring the challenges and opportunities that arise when addressing both environmental and social issues.



Brownfield redevelopment projects often face significant challenges, including financial, legal, and technical barriers. These challenges are compounded when considering environmental justice, which seeks to address the disproportionate burden of environmental hazards on marginalized communities. Environmental justice advocates argue that these communities are often the most affected by brownfield sites and should have a say in the redevelopment process. This chapter will examine the role of environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment and the importance of community involvement in these projects.



The chapter will also discuss the various strategies and approaches used in brownfield redevelopment, such as risk assessment, remediation, and reuse planning. These strategies must consider not only the environmental impacts but also the potential social and economic benefits for the surrounding community. Additionally, the chapter will explore the role of government policies and regulations in promoting sustainable and equitable brownfield redevelopment.



Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of brownfield redevelopment and its intersection with environmental justice. It will highlight the challenges and opportunities in addressing contaminated sites while promoting social and environmental justice. By understanding the complexities of brownfield redevelopment, we can work towards creating sustainable and equitable communities for all.





### Section: 13.1 Environmental Justice and Brownfields:



Environmental justice is a critical aspect of brownfield redevelopment, as it seeks to address the disproportionate burden of environmental hazards on marginalized communities. These communities, often low-income and minority populations, are more likely to live near contaminated sites and suffer from the negative health and environmental impacts. Therefore, it is essential to define environmental justice and understand its role in brownfield redevelopment.



#### 13.1a Definition of Environmental Justice



Environmental justice is a social movement that aims to address environmental injustice, which is the exposure of poor and marginalized communities to harm from hazardous waste, resource extraction, and other land uses from which they do not receive benefits. It is a concept that encompasses distributive, procedural, and recognition justice. Distributive justice refers to the equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits, while procedural justice focuses on the fair and meaningful participation of all stakeholders in decision-making processes. Recognition justice recognizes the oppression and difference in environmental justice communities and seeks to address them. Additionally, the capacity of these communities to convert social goods into a flourishing society is also a crucial aspect of environmental justice.



The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as "the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies." This definition highlights the importance of including all stakeholders, especially those from marginalized communities, in environmental decision-making processes. It also recognizes the historical and systemic injustices faced by these communities and the need for fair treatment and meaningful involvement in addressing environmental issues.



Environmental justice is also discussed as environmental racism or environmental inequality. These terms highlight the disproportionate burden of environmental hazards on communities of color and low-income populations. Studies have shown that these communities are more likely to live near contaminated sites and suffer from the negative health and environmental impacts. Therefore, environmental justice seeks to address these inequalities and promote fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all stakeholders in environmental decision-making processes.



Joan Martinez-Alier's concept of the environmentalism of the poor is also crucial in understanding environmental justice. It highlights the ways in which marginalized communities, particularly those in the Global South, are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation. It also emphasizes the importance of including their perspectives and needs in environmental decision-making processes. Martinez-Alier's work also introduces the concept of "ecological distribution conflicts," which are conflicts over access to and control of natural resources and the resulting environmental impacts. These conflicts are often rooted in social and economic inequalities and must be addressed in the pursuit of environmental justice.



In conclusion, environmental justice is a critical aspect of brownfield redevelopment as it seeks to address the disproportionate burden of environmental hazards on marginalized communities. It encompasses distributive, procedural, and recognition justice and highlights the importance of including all stakeholders in decision-making processes. The EPA's definition of environmental justice and Martinez-Alier's concept of the environmentalism of the poor provide a comprehensive understanding of this concept and its role in brownfield redevelopment.

## Chapter: Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment



### Introduction:



Brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse are crucial components of environmental management. Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that may have been contaminated by hazardous substances. These properties often pose a threat to public health and the environment, and their redevelopment is essential for revitalizing communities and promoting sustainable land use. In this chapter, we will explore the process of brownfield redevelopment and the various strategies and techniques used to transform these properties into productive and safe spaces. We will also discuss the concept of adaptive reuse, which involves repurposing existing structures for new uses, and its role in brownfield redevelopment. Through this chapter, we hope to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse.





### Section: 16.1 Adaptive Reuse and Brownfields:



Brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse are two important strategies for addressing the issue of abandoned or underutilized properties that may have been contaminated by hazardous substances. These properties, known as brownfields, pose a threat to public health and the environment, and their redevelopment is essential for revitalizing communities and promoting sustainable land use.



#### 16.1a Definition of Adaptive Reuse



Adaptive reuse is the process of repurposing existing structures for new uses. This concept is closely related to the idea of recycling, but instead of materials, it involves reusing buildings and other structures. Adaptive reuse is a sustainable practice that helps reduce waste and conserve resources, as well as preserve historical and cultural landmarks.



Adaptive reuse is particularly relevant in the context of brownfield redevelopment. Many brownfield sites contain old industrial buildings or other structures that are no longer in use. These structures often have historical or architectural value, and adaptive reuse allows them to be repurposed instead of being demolished. This not only preserves the character of the community but also reduces the environmental impact of redevelopment by avoiding the need for new construction.



One example of adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment is the conversion of an old factory into a mixed-use development with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. This not only brings new life to the abandoned property but also provides much-needed housing and economic opportunities for the community.



Adaptive reuse also has economic benefits. It is often more cost-effective than new construction, as the existing structure can be renovated and repurposed instead of starting from scratch. This can be especially beneficial for smaller communities or organizations with limited resources.



However, adaptive reuse also has its challenges. The existing structure may not be suitable for the intended use, requiring significant renovations and upgrades. This can be costly and time-consuming, and may also pose safety concerns. Additionally, there may be zoning or regulatory hurdles to overcome, as the existing structure may not comply with current building codes.



Despite these challenges, adaptive reuse is a valuable tool in brownfield redevelopment. It not only promotes sustainable land use and conservation of resources but also contributes to the revitalization of communities and preservation of their history and character.

### 16.1b Definition of Brownfield Redevelopment



Brownfield redevelopment is the process of revitalizing and redeveloping abandoned or underutilized properties that may have been contaminated by hazardous substances. These properties, known as brownfields, are often located in urban areas and were previously used for industrial or commercial purposes. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines a brownfield as "a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant."



The redevelopment of brownfields is crucial for promoting sustainable land use and revitalizing communities. These properties often have a negative impact on the surrounding environment and can pose health risks to nearby residents. By redeveloping these properties, we can mitigate these risks and create new opportunities for economic growth and community development.



### 16.1c Case Studies in Adaptive Reuse and Brownfield Redevelopment



To better understand the concepts of adaptive reuse and brownfield redevelopment, let's take a look at some real-world case studies.



One successful example of adaptive reuse and brownfield redevelopment is the High Line in New York City. The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated park built on an abandoned freight rail line on Manhattan's West Side. The rail line had been out of use since 1980 and was at risk of being demolished. However, a community-led effort to repurpose the rail line into a public park was successful, and the High Line opened in 2009. The project not only preserved a piece of the city's history but also created a new public space for residents and visitors to enjoy.



Another notable case study is the redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The plant, which had been in operation for over 140 years, closed in 1995, leaving behind a massive brownfield site. The site was contaminated with hazardous substances, including heavy metals and petroleum products. However, through a partnership between the city, state, and private developers, the site was successfully remediated and redeveloped into a mixed-use community with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The project has brought new life to the area and has been recognized as a model for brownfield redevelopment.



These case studies demonstrate the potential for adaptive reuse and brownfield redevelopment to transform abandoned and contaminated properties into vibrant and sustainable spaces. However, it is important to note that each project is unique and requires careful planning, collaboration, and remediation to ensure the safety and success of the redevelopment. 





### Section: 16.2 Adaptive Reuse Strategies:



Adaptive reuse is a valuable strategy for addressing the issue of abandoned or underutilized properties, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. In this section, we will discuss some key strategies for implementing adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment projects.



#### 16.2a Overview of Adaptive Reuse Strategies



Adaptive reuse strategies can be broadly categorized into three main approaches: preservation, rehabilitation, and renovation. Each approach involves different levels of intervention and can be applied to different types of structures.



Preservation involves minimal intervention and focuses on maintaining the original character and features of a structure. This approach is often used for historically significant buildings or structures with unique architectural features. Preservation may involve minor repairs and maintenance to ensure the structure remains stable and safe, but the goal is to preserve the original structure as much as possible.



Rehabilitation involves more significant interventions, such as repairing or replacing damaged or deteriorated elements of a structure. This approach is often used for structures that have some historical or architectural value but may not be considered significant enough for preservation. Rehabilitation may also involve updating the structure to meet current building codes and standards.



Renovation involves the most extensive interventions and often results in a complete transformation of the structure. This approach is typically used for structures that have little historical or architectural value but can be repurposed for a new use. Renovation may involve significant modifications to the structure, such as adding new floors or changing the layout, to accommodate the new use.



When considering which approach to use for a specific structure, it is important to consider the goals of the project, the condition of the structure, and the resources available. Preservation may be the best option for structures with significant historical or architectural value, while renovation may be more suitable for structures that can be completely transformed for a new use.



In addition to these three main approaches, there are also various techniques and methods that can be used in adaptive reuse projects. These include:



- Adaptive reuse of materials: This involves salvaging and repurposing materials from the existing structure, reducing waste and conserving resources.

- Adaptive reuse of space: This involves reconfiguring the layout of a structure to accommodate a new use, such as converting a warehouse into a residential building.

- Adaptive reuse of systems: This involves repurposing existing systems, such as plumbing or electrical, to meet the needs of the new use.

- Adaptive reuse of technology: This involves incorporating new technology into the existing structure, such as installing energy-efficient systems or using smart building technology.



By utilizing these strategies and techniques, adaptive reuse can be a sustainable and cost-effective approach to brownfield redevelopment. It not only helps revitalize communities and preserve historical and cultural landmarks but also promotes responsible land use and resource conservation.





### Section: 16.2 Adaptive Reuse Strategies:



Adaptive reuse is a valuable strategy for addressing the issue of abandoned or underutilized properties, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. In this section, we will discuss some key strategies for implementing adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment projects.



#### 16.2b Selection of Adaptive Reuse Strategies



When considering which adaptive reuse strategy to use for a specific structure, there are several factors that must be taken into account. These include the goals of the project, the condition of the structure, and the available resources.



The first step in selecting an adaptive reuse strategy is to clearly define the goals of the project. This may include preserving the historical or architectural significance of the structure, repurposing it for a new use, or simply ensuring its stability and safety. By clearly defining the goals, it becomes easier to determine which approach will best achieve those goals.



The condition of the structure is also an important factor to consider. Preservation may be the best approach for a structure with significant historical or architectural value, but if the structure is in poor condition, rehabilitation or renovation may be necessary to ensure its stability and safety. A thorough assessment of the structure's condition should be conducted before selecting an adaptive reuse strategy.



Another important consideration is the available resources. Preservation may be the ideal approach, but it can also be the most costly. If resources are limited, rehabilitation or renovation may be a more feasible option. It is important to carefully consider the budget and available resources before deciding on an adaptive reuse strategy.



In addition to these factors, it is also important to consult with experts in the field of adaptive reuse. Architects, engineers, and preservation specialists can provide valuable insights and recommendations for the best approach to take for a specific structure.



Ultimately, the selection of an adaptive reuse strategy should be a well-informed decision that takes into account the goals of the project, the condition of the structure, and the available resources. By carefully considering these factors and consulting with experts, the most appropriate and effective strategy can be chosen for each individual brownfield redevelopment project.





### Section: 16.2 Adaptive Reuse Strategies:



Adaptive reuse is a valuable strategy for addressing the issue of abandoned or underutilized properties, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. In this section, we will discuss some key strategies for implementing adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment projects.



#### 16.2c Case Studies in Adaptive Reuse Strategies



To better understand the practical application of adaptive reuse strategies, let's take a look at some case studies of successful projects.



One notable example is the adaptive reuse of the IONA Technologies building in Dublin, Ireland. Originally built in the 1990s as a headquarters for the software company, the building was later abandoned and left vacant for several years. In 2016, the building was purchased by a developer who saw the potential for adaptive reuse. The building was renovated and repurposed into a mixed-use development, with office space, retail shops, and residential units. This project not only revitalized a previously abandoned property, but also brought new economic opportunities to the surrounding community.



Another successful case study is the adaptive reuse of a former industrial site in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The site, which was once home to a steel mill, had been abandoned for decades and was heavily contaminated with hazardous materials. Through a combination of remediation efforts and adaptive reuse strategies, the site was transformed into a mixed-use development with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. This project not only cleaned up a contaminated brownfield, but also provided much-needed housing and job opportunities for the local community.



These case studies demonstrate the potential for adaptive reuse to not only revitalize abandoned properties, but also bring economic and social benefits to the surrounding community. However, it is important to note that the success of these projects was not without challenges. Factors such as budget constraints, structural condition, and community involvement all played a role in the decision-making process and implementation of adaptive reuse strategies.



In addition to these case studies, there are also several systematic approaches to implementing adaptive reuse strategies. These include the "app->comp" model, which allows for the reuse of existing applications as modules in new projects, and the CO paradigm, which emphasizes the optimization of reusability in data-oriented activities. By utilizing these systematic approaches, developers can further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of adaptive reuse strategies.



In conclusion, adaptive reuse is a valuable tool in the redevelopment of brownfield sites. By carefully considering factors such as project goals, structural condition, and available resources, and by utilizing systematic approaches, developers can successfully implement adaptive reuse strategies and bring new life to abandoned properties. 





### Section: 16.3 Adaptive Reuse and Community Engagement:

Engaging the community in adaptive reuse projects also helps to address potential challenges and concerns. Traditional engagement programs, such as focus groups, often result in lack of representation and input from the community. With crowd-funded models, forms of engagement are built into the process, enabling a kind of emergent urbanism where the use of space is optimized on terms set by its users. This reclamation of people's power can be seen as a soft, spatial version of Hacktivism.



However, it is important to note that community engagement in adaptive reuse projects may also face challenges. These include organizational drawbacks, such as forking of projects, abandoned projects, and the emergence of cliques. Additionally, organized campaigns of fear, uncertainty, and doubt may also arise. It is important for project leaders to address these challenges and ensure that the community remains engaged and informed throughout the project.

While brownfield redevelopment aims to remediate and redevelop contaminated sites, historic preservation seeks to protect and preserve the historical significance of a site. This chapter will delve into the complexities of balancing these objectives and finding solutions that benefit both practices.



The chapter will also discuss the various regulations and policies that govern brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation, including the National Historic Preservation Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. These regulations play a crucial role in guiding the decision-making process and ensuring that both practices are carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner.



Furthermore, this chapter will explore the economic, social, and environmental benefits of brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation. By repurposing contaminated sites with historical significance, these practices can contribute to economic growth, create job opportunities, and revitalize communities. They also help to reduce urban sprawl and promote sustainable land use.



Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation. It will highlight the challenges, opportunities, and benefits of these practices and emphasize the importance of responsible and sustainable environmental management. 





### Section: 17.1 Historic Preservation and Brownfields:



Brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation are two practices that share a common goal of revitalizing and repurposing underutilized or abandoned properties. However, these practices often have conflicting objectives and face unique challenges. In this section, we will explore the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation, and the complexities of balancing their objectives.



#### 17.1a Definition of Historic Preservation



Historic preservation, also known as built heritage preservation or built heritage conservation, is an endeavor that seeks to preserve, conserve, and protect buildings, objects, landscapes, or other artifacts of historical significance. It is a philosophical concept that became popular in the twentieth century, which maintains that cities, as products of centuries' development, should be obligated to protect their patrimonial legacy. The term refers specifically to the preservation of the built environment, and not to preservation of, for example, primeval forests or wilderness.



## Areas of Professional, Paid Practice



Paid work in historic preservation can be divided into several practice areas, including regulatory compliance, architecture and construction, historic sites/museums, advocacy, and downtown revitalization/rejuvenation. Each of these areas requires a different set of skills, knowledge, and abilities.



### United States



In the United States, the majority of professional, paid practice in historic preservation falls under the category of regulatory compliance. This area is driven by laws, regulations, and guidelines at the federal, state, and local levels. At the federal level, these include the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and associated regulations, such as Section 106 (54 USC 306108, formerly known as 36 CFR 800), National Register of Historic Places (54 USC 302101-302108), and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards (36 CFR 67). Many states have laws that reference these federal regulations or create parallel regulations using similar language. At the local level, preservation laws and regulations are known as "preservation ordinances" and require private property owners to seek a "certificate of appropriateness" when making modifications to existing buildings listed in a local historical register.

### Section: 17.1 Historic Preservation and Brownfields:



Brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation are two practices that share a common goal of revitalizing and repurposing underutilized or abandoned properties. However, these practices often have conflicting objectives and face unique challenges. In this section, we will explore the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation, and the complexities of balancing their objectives.



#### 17.1a Definition of Historic Preservation



Historic preservation, also known as built heritage preservation or built heritage conservation, is an endeavor that seeks to preserve, conserve, and protect buildings, objects, landscapes, or other artifacts of historical significance. It is a philosophical concept that became popular in the twentieth century, which maintains that cities, as products of centuries' development, should be obligated to protect their patrimonial legacy. The term refers specifically to the preservation of the built environment, and not to preservation of, for example, primeval forests or wilderness.



Historic preservation is a multi-faceted practice that involves a variety of professionals and stakeholders. It encompasses not only the physical preservation of buildings and structures, but also the preservation of cultural and social significance. This includes the preservation of cultural traditions, stories, and memories associated with a particular place or building. Historic preservation also plays a crucial role in maintaining a sense of community and identity, as well as promoting tourism and economic development.



## Areas of Professional, Paid Practice



Paid work in historic preservation can be divided into several practice areas, including regulatory compliance, architecture and construction, historic sites/museums, advocacy, and downtown revitalization/rejuvenation. Each of these areas requires a different set of skills, knowledge, and abilities.



### United States



In the United States, the majority of professional, paid practice in historic preservation falls under the category of regulatory compliance. This area is driven by laws, regulations, and guidelines at the federal, state, and local levels. At the federal level, these include the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and associated regulations, such as Section 106 (54 USC 306108, formerly known as 36 CFR 800), National Register of Historic Places (54 USC 302101-302108), and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards (36 CFR 6

The role of historic preservation in brownfield redevelopment is a complex and often contentious issue. On one hand, historic preservation can provide valuable insights and resources for the redevelopment of brownfield sites. On the other hand, the goals of historic preservation and brownfield redevelopment may conflict, leading to challenges and obstacles in the redevelopment process.



One of the main benefits of incorporating historic preservation into brownfield redevelopment is the potential for adaptive reuse. As mentioned in the related context, adaptive building is the process of repurposing old buildings for new uses, which can be more environmentally sustainable and economically friendly than building new structures. Historic preservationists can provide expertise in identifying and preserving the historical and architectural significance of a building, while also finding ways to adapt it for modern use.



In addition, historic preservation can also play a role in mitigating environmental hazards on brownfield sites. By preserving and repurposing existing buildings, the need for demolition and new construction is reduced, which can help prevent further contamination of the site. Historic preservationists can also work with environmental experts to ensure that any necessary remediation efforts are carried out in a way that preserves the historical integrity of the site.



However, there are also challenges and conflicts that can arise when trying to incorporate historic preservation into brownfield redevelopment. One of the main challenges is balancing the goals of historic preservation with the goals of brownfield redevelopment. While historic preservation seeks to preserve the past, brownfield redevelopment is focused on revitalizing and repurposing underutilized or abandoned properties for modern use. This can lead to conflicts over the level of preservation that is necessary or appropriate for a particular site.



Another challenge is the potential for increased costs and delays in the redevelopment process. Historic preservation can be a time-consuming and expensive process, as it often involves extensive research, documentation, and review processes. This can be a barrier for developers who are looking to quickly and efficiently redevelop a brownfield site. In addition, the presence of historical artifacts or structures on a site may require additional remediation efforts, which can add to the overall cost of the project.



Despite these challenges, the role of historic preservation in brownfield redevelopment is an important one. By incorporating historic preservation into the redevelopment process, we can not only revitalize and repurpose underutilized properties, but also preserve our cultural heritage and promote sustainable development practices. It is crucial for all stakeholders involved in brownfield redevelopment to work together to find a balance between historic preservation and redevelopment goals, in order to create successful and sustainable projects.

## Chapter: Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment



### Introduction:



Brownfield redevelopment is a crucial aspect of environmental management, as it involves the revitalization of contaminated or abandoned sites for productive use. These sites, known as brownfields, pose significant environmental and health risks to surrounding communities. However, with proper management and remediation, brownfields can be transformed into valuable assets, contributing to economic growth and sustainable development.



In this chapter, we will focus on the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and food systems. Food systems refer to the processes and infrastructure involved in producing, distributing, and consuming food. Brownfield redevelopment can have a significant impact on food systems, as it can provide new opportunities for urban agriculture, food production, and access to fresh, healthy food in underserved communities.



We will explore the challenges and opportunities of incorporating food systems into brownfield redevelopment projects. This includes addressing potential contamination issues, designing sustainable and resilient food systems, and engaging with local communities to ensure equitable access to food resources. Additionally, we will discuss case studies and best practices from successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have integrated food systems.



By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating food systems into brownfield redevelopment. This knowledge can inform future projects and policies, promoting sustainable and equitable development in communities.

Brownfield redevelopment is a crucial aspect of environmental management, as it involves the revitalization of contaminated or abandoned sites for productive use. These sites, known as brownfields, pose significant environmental and health risks to surrounding communities. However, with proper management and remediation, brownfields can be transformed into valuable assets, contributing to economic growth and sustainable development.



In this section, we will explore the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and food systems. Food systems refer to the processes and infrastructure involved in producing, distributing, and consuming food. Brownfield redevelopment can have a significant impact on food systems, as it can provide new opportunities for urban agriculture, food production, and access to fresh, healthy food in underserved communities.



#### 18.1a Definition of Food Systems



The term "food system" encompasses the interconnected systems and processes that influence nutrition, food, health, community development, and agriculture. It includes all processes and infrastructure involved in feeding a population, from growing and harvesting to processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, distribution, and disposal of food and food-related items. This definition falls within the broader concept of agri-food systems, which encompasses the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-adding activities in the primary production of food and non-food agricultural products.



Food systems operate within and are influenced by social, political, economic, technological, and environmental contexts. They also require human resources that provide labor, research, and education. Food systems can be categorized as either conventional or alternative, depending on their model of food lifespan from origin to plate. Additionally, food systems are dependent on a multitude of ecosystem services, such as natural pest regulation, microorganisms providing nitrogen-fixation, and pollinators.

Transportation and brownfields have a complex relationship that must be carefully managed during the brownfield redevelopment process. In this section, we will explore the definition of transportation and its role in brownfield redevelopment.



#### 20.1a Definition of Transportation



Transportation is the movement of people, goods, or animals from one place to another. It is a crucial aspect of modern society, enabling economic and social activities to take place. There are various means of transportation, including animals, vehicles, and infrastructure such as roads, railways, and waterways.



Animals have been used for transportation for thousands of years, with pack animals and riding animals being the most common. However, with the advancement of technology, vehicles have become the primary means of transportation. A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. It must provide its own propulsion, which is most commonly done through a steam engine, combustion engine, electric motor, jet engine, or rocket. Vehicles also require a system of converting energy into movement, such as wheels, propellers, or pressure.



Vehicles are typically operated by a driver, but some systems, such as people movers and rapid transits, are fully automated. For passenger transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. In some cases, such as automobiles, bicycles, or simple aircraft, one of the passengers may also act as the driver.



In recent years, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought about new emerging technologies for transportation, such as Connected Vehicles and Autonomous Driving. These innovations have the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry, but concerns remain about safety and cybersecurity, particularly in regards to connected and autonomous mobility.



Transportation operations can be divided into private and public transport. Private transport is solely subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates it themselves. On the other hand, public transport and freight transport are typically operated by private enterprises or governments. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. In some countries, there is a national airline and railway, but many have been privatized since the 1980s. International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation, but ports can be publicly owned.



In the context of brownfield redevelopment, transportation plays a significant role in the development and use of contaminated sites. The location and accessibility of transportation infrastructure can greatly impact the potential uses and value of a brownfield site. Additionally, transportation can also be a source of contamination, as many brownfield sites are located near highways, railroads, and other transportation facilities that may have contributed to the contamination of the site.



In the next subsection, we will discuss the various transportation-related challenges that may arise during the brownfield redevelopment process and explore potential solutions to address them.

These properties are often located in urban areas, where transportation infrastructure is already established.



The presence of transportation infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and waterways, can make brownfield sites more attractive for redevelopment. This is because it provides easy access to the site for construction materials, equipment, and workers. It also allows for efficient transportation of goods and services once the site is redeveloped.



However, transportation can also pose challenges for brownfield redevelopment. The transportation infrastructure may be damaged or contaminated due to the previous use of the brownfield site, requiring remediation before redevelopment can take place. In addition, the transportation infrastructure may need to be upgraded or expanded to accommodate the increased traffic and activity that comes with a redeveloped brownfield site.



#### 20.1c Case Studies in Transportation and Brownfield Redevelopment



To better understand the relationship between transportation and brownfield redevelopment, let's examine some case studies of successful projects that have integrated transportation into their redevelopment plans.



One example is the redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Baltimore, Maryland. This 3,100-acre site was once a major steel manufacturing facility, but it closed in 2012 and left behind significant environmental contamination. The site was redeveloped into a mixed-use community, with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The project also included the construction of a new light rail station, providing easy access to the site for residents and visitors.



Another case study is the redevelopment of the former Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado. The airport was closed in 1995 and left behind a 4,700-acre site with significant environmental contamination. The site was redeveloped into a sustainable community, with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The project also included the construction of a new light rail station, connecting the community to downtown Denver and other parts of the city.

#### 20.2b Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)



Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) seek to improve safety and travel times while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions for all travelers, though focusing mainly on drivers. ITS has two systems: one for data collection/relaying, and another for data processing. Data collection can be achieved with video cameras over busy areas, sensors that detect various pieces from location of certain vehicles to infrastructure that's breaking down, and even drivers who notice an accident and use a mobile app, like Waze, to report its whereabouts.



Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) aim to make public transportation more efficient and convenient for its riders. Electronic payment methods allow users to add money to their smart cards at stations and online. APTS relay information to transit facilities about current vehicle locations to give riders expected wait times on screens at stations and directly to customers' smart phones. Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) collect information using cameras and other sensors that gather information regarding how congested roads are. Ramp meters regulate the number of cars entering highways to limit backups. Traffic signals use algorithms to optimize travel times depending on the number of cars on the road. Electronic highway signs relay information regarding travel times, detours, and accidents that may affect drivers' ability to reach their destination.



With the rise of consumer connectivity, less infrastructure is needed for these ITS to make informed decisions. Google Maps uses smartphone crowdsourcing to get information about real-time traffic conditions, allowing motorists to make decisions based on toll roads, travel times, and overall distance traveled. Cars communicate with each other and with infrastructure through Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, allowing for more efficient and safer travel.
