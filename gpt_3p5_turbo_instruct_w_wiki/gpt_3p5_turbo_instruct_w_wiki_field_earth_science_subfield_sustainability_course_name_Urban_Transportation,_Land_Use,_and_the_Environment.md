# Urban Transportation, Land Use, and the Environment: A Comprehensive Guide":





## Foreward



Welcome to "Urban Transportation, Land Use, and the Environment: A Comprehensive Guide". In this book, we will explore the complex relationship between urban transportation, land use, and the environment. As our world becomes increasingly urbanized, it is crucial to understand how these three elements interact and impact each other.



One of the most pressing issues facing our society today is energy conservation. As stated in the context, transportation accounts for a significant portion of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. This makes it a critical target for addressing global climate change. As we continue to rely on fossil fuels for transportation, it is essential to consider the impact on the environment and explore alternative solutions.



The development of suburban infrastructure has led to transportation-dependent living systems. This has resulted in high transportation energy intensity as people need to commute longer distances to jobs. As a result, the location of a building plays a crucial role in reducing embodied emissions. We will delve into the importance of urban planning and zoning reforms in promoting sustainable transportation and reducing energy consumption.



In recent years, there have been efforts at both the national and local levels to promote energy conservation and efficiency measures in transportation. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 have provided new policy signals and financial incentives for the transportation sector. We will explore these policies and their impact on promoting sustainable transportation.



Furthermore, we will also discuss the role of technology in transportation. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have the potential to reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions caused by increased vehicles. We will examine the advancements in information technology, communications, and sensors that have made ITS a viable solution for sustainable transportation.



Lastly, we will also touch upon the concept of remote work and its potential to conserve energy. With the rise of technology, many Americans now have the option to work remotely instead of commuting daily. This presents a significant opportunity to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainable transportation.



I hope this book will serve as a comprehensive guide for students, researchers, and policymakers interested in understanding the complex relationship between urban transportation, land use, and the environment. By exploring these topics, we can work towards creating more sustainable and livable cities for future generations.

In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the key concepts and themes that will be explored in this book. We will begin by discussing the role of transportation in shaping urban development and the impact it has on the environment. We will then delve into the various factors that influence transportation and land use patterns, including economic, social, and political factors. Finally, we will introduce the concept of sustainable transportation and its importance in promoting environmentally friendly and equitable urban development.



Throughout this chapter, we will also highlight the challenges and opportunities that arise in the context of developing countries. These countries often face unique and complex issues related to urban transportation and land use, and it is important to understand these challenges in order to develop effective and sustainable solutions.



In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of urban transportation, land use, and the environment, and explore how they are interconnected. We will also examine case studies from different cities around the world to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issues and potential solutions. By the end of this book, readers will have a better understanding of the complex relationship between urban transportation, land use, and the environment, and how it can be managed in a way that promotes sustainable and inclusive urban development.





### Section: 1.1 Urbanization and Transportation:



Urbanization is a global phenomenon that has been occurring for centuries, but has accelerated in recent years due to various political, economic, and cultural factors. It is the process of migration from rural to urban areas, resulting in the growth of cities and their populations. This growth has been particularly rapid in developing countries, where urbanization has been driven by economic opportunities and the promise of a better quality of life.



The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs reported in 2014 that for the first time, more than half of the world's population lives in cities. This trend is expected to continue, with an additional 2.5 billion people projected to live in cities by 2050. This rapid urbanization has significant implications for transportation and land use, as cities must accommodate the increasing demand for mobility and development while also addressing environmental concerns.



In the context of urban transportation, land use refers to the way in which land is allocated and utilized for different purposes, such as residential, commercial, or industrial. The relationship between transportation and land use is a complex and dynamic one, as each influences the other. For example, the location of transportation infrastructure can shape the development of land use patterns, while land use decisions can impact the demand for transportation.



One of the key challenges in managing urban transportation and land use is achieving a balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability. As cities continue to grow and develop, the demand for transportation increases, leading to higher levels of air and noise pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. This not only has negative impacts on the environment, but also on public health and quality of life.



To address these challenges, the concept of sustainable transportation has emerged as a key focus in urban planning and development. Sustainable transportation aims to provide efficient and equitable mobility while minimizing negative impacts on the environment. This can be achieved through various strategies, such as promoting the use of public transportation, implementing policies to reduce car dependency, and encouraging the development of compact and walkable communities.



In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of urban transportation, land use, and the environment, and explore how they are interconnected. We will also examine case studies from different cities around the world to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issues and potential solutions. By the end of this book, readers will have a better understanding of the complex relationship between urban transportation, land use, and the environment, and how it can be managed in a way that promotes sustainable and equitable development.

This trend is expected to continue, with an additional 2.5 billion people projected to live in cities by 2050. This rapid urbanization has significant implications for transportation and land use, as cities must accommodate the increasing demand for mobility and development while also addressing environmental concerns.



The impact of urbanization on transportation is multifaceted. On one hand, the concentration of people in urban areas leads to increased demand for transportation services, resulting in the development of transportation infrastructure such as roads, highways, and public transit systems. This can improve accessibility and connectivity within and between cities, facilitating economic growth and social interactions.



However, the unplanned and often rapid nature of urban development can also have negative consequences for transportation. Urban sprawl, the outward expansion of cities into surrounding areas, has been linked to increased car dependency and decreased use of public transportation. This is due to the higher costs associated with providing public services, such as water, sewers, and electricity, in low-density areas. As a result, residents of these areas often spend a higher proportion of their income on transportation, leading to economic losses and negative impacts on the environment.



Furthermore, the location of transportation infrastructure can also shape land use patterns. For example, the development of highways and parking structures can decrease the desirability of adjacent areas, leading to a decrease in taxable land and revenue. This can also contribute to urban sprawl and further exacerbate the negative impacts of car dependency.



To address these challenges, the concept of sustainable transportation has emerged as a key focus in urban planning. This approach aims to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability by promoting the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit. By reducing car dependency and promoting more compact and connected urban development, sustainable transportation can help mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on transportation and the environment.



In conclusion, the rapid urbanization of cities has significant implications for transportation and land use. While it can lead to increased demand for transportation services and economic growth, it can also contribute to negative impacts such as car dependency and urban sprawl. To address these challenges, a sustainable approach to transportation and land use is crucial in promoting economic growth and environmental sustainability in urban areas.

TDM originated in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, in response to the economic impacts of the 1973 and 1979 oil crises. The sharp increase in oil prices led to long lines at gas stations, making it clear that alternatives to single-occupancy commuter travel were needed to save energy, improve air quality, and reduce peak period congestion. The concept of TDM was borrowed from mainstream transport planning in Europe, where the private car was not seen as the only solution for urban mobility. For example, the Dutch Transport Structure Scheme has required since the 1970s that demand for additional vehicle capacity be met only if it has a positive contribution to societal welfare. This approach has been successful in reducing the rate of growth in vehicle traffic.



Some cities outside of Europe have also consistently taken a demand management approach to transportation planning. For instance, Singapore has implemented a comprehensive TDM program since the 1970s, which includes measures such as road pricing, parking management, and public transportation improvements. This has resulted in a significant reduction in car ownership and usage, as well as improved air quality and reduced traffic congestion.



#### 4.4b Strategies for Transportation Demand Management



There are various strategies that can be employed to achieve TDM goals. These include:



- Encouraging the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, biking, and walking, through infrastructure improvements and incentives.

- Implementing road pricing schemes, such as tolls or congestion charges, to discourage single-occupancy vehicle use and encourage carpooling or the use of public transit.

- Managing parking supply and pricing to discourage driving and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation.

- Implementing telecommuting and flexible work schedules to reduce the need for daily commuting.

- Providing information and education to travelers about alternative modes of transportation and the benefits of TDM.

- Coordinating land use and transportation planning to reduce the need for long-distance travel and promote compact, walkable communities.



#### 4.4c Challenges and Solutions for Transportation Demand Management



Despite the potential benefits of TDM, there are several challenges that must be addressed in its implementation. These include:



- Resistance from drivers who are used to the convenience and independence of single-occupancy vehicle use.

- Lack of political will and support for TDM measures.

- Limited funding and resources for TDM programs.

- Difficulty in changing ingrained travel behaviors and habits.



To overcome these challenges, it is important to have a comprehensive and coordinated approach to TDM. This includes involving stakeholders from various sectors, such as government agencies, transportation providers, employers, and community groups, in the planning and implementation of TDM strategies. It is also crucial to have strong leadership and support from government officials to ensure the success of TDM programs.



In addition, it is important to continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of TDM strategies and make adjustments as needed. This can help to identify successful strategies and areas for improvement, as well as provide evidence for the benefits of TDM to gain support and funding for future programs.



Overall, TDM is a crucial component of sustainable urban transportation planning. By reducing travel demand and promoting sustainable modes of transportation, TDM can help to improve the environment, public health, and overall quality of life in cities. However, it requires a coordinated and comprehensive approach, as well as strong leadership and support, to overcome challenges and achieve its goals.

TOD is a planning strategy that focuses on creating compact, mixed-use communities that are centered around a central transit stop. This transit stop can be a train station, light rail or bus stop, and is surrounded by a high-density mixed-use area. The goal of TOD is to create a walkable community where residents can easily access public transportation, reducing the need for personal vehicles.



TOD is typically designed to be more walkable than other built-up areas, with smaller block sizes and less land dedicated to automobiles. The densest areas of TOD are usually located within a radius of 1/4 to 1/2 mile (400 to 800 m) around the central transit stop. This distance is considered to be an appropriate scale for pedestrians, solving the "last mile problem" and making it easier for people to access public transportation.



TOD is not a new concept and has been implemented in various forms in different countries. For example, many new towns created after World War II in Japan, Sweden, and France have TOD characteristics. In the Netherlands and Denmark, TOD principles are integrated into the planning of reclaimed land and exurban developments, promoting the use of bicycles for local transportation.



In the United States, a half-mile-radius circle has become the de facto standard for rail-transit catchment areas for TODs. This distance corresponds to the average distance someone can walk in 10 minutes and is a common estimate for the distance people are willing to walk to access a rail station. The half-mile ring is a little over 1 square mile in size.



In summary, TOD is a planning strategy that aims to create compact, mixed-use communities centered around a central transit stop. By promoting walkability and reducing the need for personal vehicles, TOD can help increase public transport ridership and promote sustainable urban growth.

This transit stop can be a train station, light rail or bus stop, and is surrounded by a high-density mixed-use area. The goal of TOD is to create a walkable community where residents can easily access public transportation, reducing the need for personal vehicles.



TOD is typically designed to be more walkable than other built-up areas, with smaller block sizes and less land dedicated to automobiles. The densest areas of TOD are usually located within a radius of 1/4 to 1/2 mile (400 to 800 m) around the central transit stop. This distance is considered to be an appropriate scale for pedestrians, solving the "last mile problem" and making it easier for people to access public transportation.



TOD is not a new concept and has been implemented in various forms in different countries. For example, many new towns created after World War II in Japan, Sweden, and France have TOD characteristics. In the Netherlands and Denmark, TOD principles are integrated into the planning of reclaimed land and exurban developments, promoting the use of bicycles for local transportation.



In the United States, a half-mile-radius circle has become the de facto standard for rail-transit catchment areas for TODs. This distance corresponds to a 10-minute walk, which is considered to be the maximum distance most people are willing to walk to access public transportation. This highlights the importance of walkability in TOD planning.



### Subsection: 10.2b Benefits of Transit-Oriented Development



TOD has numerous benefits, particularly in terms of the environment and the economy. In terms of the environment, TOD has been shown to reduce multiple types of emissions in cities such as Los Angeles and Dhaka. This is due to various factors, including residents having more travel options, reduced travel distances for everyday activities, and higher density housing reducing energy use per residence. In addition, TOD can also aid in reducing travel-related CO2 emissions on a community level, specifically for work and school trips.



However, it is important to note that TOD has also been found to contribute to the urban heat island effect in cities like Brisbane. This is due to the larger portion of non-porous land and less natural spaces in TOD areas. Therefore, when planning TOD, it is crucial to consider the impact on the environment and implement strategies to mitigate any negative effects.



In terms of the economy, TOD has been seen to have a positive impact on businesses and property values. In cities like Phoenix and San Diego, TOD has been linked to an increase in new businesses and an increase in property values, particularly for condominiums. This is due to the convenience and accessibility of public transportation in TOD areas, making them attractive locations for businesses and residents.



However, it is important to note that TOD may also lead to a decrease in manufacturing facilities. This is likely due to the higher land values and focus on mixed-use development in TOD areas. Therefore, it is important for planners to consider the potential trade-offs and make informed decisions when implementing TOD.



In conclusion, TOD has numerous benefits in terms of the environment and the economy. However, it is important to carefully plan and consider the potential impacts in order to create successful and sustainable TOD communities.

In a 2005 report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), road vehicles were identified as the second-largest source of VOC emissions in the U.S. at 26%, with non-road equipment, such as gasoline and diesel stations, contributing 19%. Solvents used in the manufacturing of paints and other products also contribute to VOC emissions.



To address the issue of air pollution from transportation, the EPA has implemented regulations and standards for vehicle emissions. These include the Clean Air Act, which sets limits on the amount of pollutants that can be emitted by vehicles, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which require automakers to meet certain fuel efficiency targets.



In addition to these regulations, transportation planners and decision-makers must also consider the environmental impacts of transportation when developing investment strategies. By incorporating air quality data into their planning, they can make informed decisions about the design and maintenance of transportation infrastructure to minimize its impact on air quality.





### Section: 12.2 Air Quality and Transportation:



Air quality is a critical consideration in urban transportation planning. The emissions from transportation vehicles can have significant impacts on the environment and public health. In this section, we will discuss the main pollutants emitted by transportation vehicles and their effects on air quality.

Transportation is a major source of air pollution, contributing to the formation of smog, acid rain, and other harmful effects on the environment. The main pollutants emitted by transportation vehicles include nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone, and carbon monoxide (CO).



NOx is a group of gases that react with other compounds in the atmosphere to form nitric acid vapor and related particles. These particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause respiratory diseases, such as emphysema and bronchitis. In addition, NOx emissions contribute to the formation of acid rain, which can harm plants and aquatic life.



VOCs are gases emitted by transportation vehicles that react with NOx in the presence of sunlight to form ground-level ozone. Ozone is a primary ingredient in smog and can irritate the respiratory system, reduce lung capacity, and have negative effects on the ecosystem.



CO is a colorless and odorless gas that is emitted by transportation vehicles and can be harmful to human health. In high concentrations, it can cause carbon monoxide poisoning, which is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries.



In a 2005 report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), road vehicles were identified as the second-largest source of VOC emissions in the U.S. at 26%, with non-road equipment, such as gasoline and diesel stations, contributing 19%. Solvents used in the manufacturing of paints and other products also contribute to VOC emissions.



To address the issue of air pollution from transportation, the EPA has implemented various regulations and programs. One example is the Clean Air Act, which sets national air quality standards and requires states to develop plans to reduce emissions from transportation sources. Additionally, the EPA has established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and the environment from harmful air pollutants.



### Subsection: 12.2b Case Studies of Air Quality and Transportation



To further understand the impact of transportation on air quality, let's examine some case studies from different cities around the world.



#### Los Angeles, California



Los Angeles is known for its heavy traffic and smog, making it a prime example of the effects of transportation on air quality. In the 1960s, the city experienced severe smog episodes, leading to the implementation of the Clean Air Act and the establishment of the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Through the implementation of various regulations and programs, such as the Zero-Emission Vehicle Program, Los Angeles has seen a significant improvement in air quality over the years.



#### Beijing, China



Beijing is another city that has faced major air quality issues due to transportation emissions. In 2008, the city hosted the Summer Olympics and implemented strict measures to reduce air pollution, such as limiting vehicle use and shutting down factories. These efforts resulted in a significant improvement in air quality during the games, but the city continues to face challenges in maintaining clean air due to its high population and heavy traffic.



#### London, United Kingdom



London has implemented a congestion charge in the city center to reduce traffic and emissions. This has led to a decrease in air pollution and an increase in public transportation usage. The city has also implemented low-emission zones and encouraged the use of electric and hybrid vehicles. These efforts have resulted in a decrease in NOx and particulate matter emissions, improving air quality in the city.



These case studies demonstrate the importance of considering air quality in urban transportation planning and the effectiveness of implementing regulations and programs to reduce emissions. As cities continue to grow and face challenges in maintaining clean air, it is crucial to prioritize sustainable transportation options and continue to implement measures to reduce emissions from transportation sources.

However, there is still much work to be done in addressing air quality and transportation. As urban populations continue to grow and more vehicles are on the road, the impact on air quality will only increase. In addition, the rise of ride-sharing services and the potential for autonomous vehicles may also have an impact on air quality and emissions.



### Subsection: 12.2b The Role of Land Use in Air Quality and Transportation



While vehicle emissions play a significant role in air quality, land use also has a significant impact. The way cities are designed and the location of different land uses can affect the amount of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and therefore, the amount of emissions.



For example, cities with a compact, mixed-use design tend to have lower VMT and emissions compared to sprawling, car-dependent cities. This is because in compact cities, people can walk, bike, or take public transportation to access different destinations, reducing the need for driving. In contrast, in sprawling cities, people often have to drive longer distances to reach their destinations, resulting in higher VMT and emissions.



In addition, the location of different land uses, such as residential, commercial, and industrial, can also impact air quality. For instance, if residential areas are located near major highways or industrial areas, residents may be exposed to higher levels of pollutants from vehicle emissions and industrial activities.



To address these issues, urban planners and policymakers can consider incorporating land use strategies that promote compact, mixed-use development and reduce the need for driving. This can include creating walkable and bikeable neighborhoods, improving public transportation systems, and promoting the use of alternative modes of transportation.



### Subsection: 12.2c Future Trends in Air Quality and Transportation



As technology continues to advance, there are several potential future trends that could impact air quality and transportation. One trend is the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles. Electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, reducing the amount of pollutants emitted from transportation. Autonomous vehicles, on the other hand, have the potential to reduce traffic congestion and improve fuel efficiency, which could also lead to lower emissions.



Another trend is the use of alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and biofuels. These fuels have the potential to reduce emissions from transportation, but their widespread adoption will depend on factors such as infrastructure availability and cost-effectiveness.



In addition, the integration of smart transportation systems, such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and connected vehicles, could also have a positive impact on air quality. These systems can help optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve fuel efficiency, resulting in lower emissions.



However, it is important to consider the potential unintended consequences of these future trends. For example, the production and disposal of electric vehicle batteries could have environmental impacts, and the use of autonomous vehicles may lead to increased vehicle miles traveled and therefore, higher emissions.



Overall, it is crucial for policymakers and urban planners to carefully consider the potential impacts of these future trends on air quality and transportation, and to implement strategies that prioritize both environmental and public health concerns. 





### Section: 12.3 Noise Pollution and Transportation:



Noise pollution is a major environmental concern in urban areas, and transportation is a significant contributor to this issue.

In fact, aerodynamic noise only becomes a significant factor at very high speeds.



The effects of persistent traffic noise can have serious consequences on human health. Studies have shown that noise levels above 40 dB(A) can disrupt sleep, while levels above 55 dB(A) can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. In Germany, it is estimated that 2.9% of myocardial infarction cases can be attributed to road traffic noise, with the 1.5% of the population exposed to noise levels above 75 dB(A) accounting for 27.13% of those cases. In total, it is estimated that 800,023 Disability-adjusted life years are lost due to road traffic noise in urban populations in the EU. Similarly, in the United States, 13.2% of the population is potentially exposed to road noise levels above 45 dB(A), with 5.5% exposed to levels above 55 dB(A).



In addition to its impact on human health, noise pollution from transportation also has negative effects on the environment. The constant noise from traffic can disrupt the natural habitats of animals and interfere with their communication and behavior. This can have a cascading effect on the ecosystem and contribute to the decline of certain species.



To address the issue of noise pollution from transportation, there are several strategies that can be implemented. One approach is to reduce the overall number of vehicles on the road through the promotion of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, biking, and walking. This can also help to reduce traffic congestion, which is a major contributor to noise pollution. Additionally, implementing noise barriers and sound-absorbing pavement can help to mitigate the noise levels in areas with high traffic volume.



It is also important to consider the design and placement of transportation infrastructure to minimize noise pollution. For example, highways and major roads can be designed with noise barriers and sound-absorbing materials to reduce the impact on nearby communities. Similarly, urban planners can consider the placement of residential areas and other noise-sensitive land uses away from major transportation corridors.



In conclusion, noise pollution is a significant environmental consideration in urban transportation. It not only has negative effects on human health but also on the environment and wildlife. By implementing strategies to reduce noise levels and carefully planning transportation infrastructure, we can create more livable and sustainable cities.
