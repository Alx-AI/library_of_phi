### Subsection 1.1a: Overview of Maxwell's Equations



Before delving into the individual equations, let us first understand the general form of Maxwell's Equations.

### Subsection 1.1b: Historical Background



The development of Maxwell's Equations can be traced back to the 19th century, when scientists were trying to understand the nature of electricity and magnetism. In 1820, Hans Christian Oersted discovered that an electric current could produce a magnetic field, and in 1831, Michael Faraday showed that a changing magnetic field could induce an electric current. These findings laid the foundation for the concept of electromagnetism.



In the mid-1800s, James Clerk Maxwell built upon the work of Oersted and Faraday and developed a set of equations that unified the theories of electricity and magnetism. He also introduced the concept of displacement current, which completed the set of equations and allowed for the prediction of electromagnetic waves. This was a groundbreaking discovery, as it showed that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation.



Maxwell's Equations have since been refined and expanded upon by other scientists, but they remain a fundamental part of our understanding of electromagnetism. They have also played a crucial role in the development of modern technologies, such as radio, television, and wireless communication.

### Section 1.2: Conservation Laws: Energy, Poynting Theorem



In this section, we will explore the concept of conservation laws in the context of electromagnetic theory. Specifically, we will focus on the conservation of energy and the Poynting theorem, which relates the flow of energy in electromagnetic fields.



### Subsection 1.2a: Definition of Energy Conservation



Energy conservation is a fundamental principle in physics that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. In the context of electromagnetism, this means that the total energy in a closed system remains constant over time.



The conservation of energy is described mathematically by the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. In the case of electromagnetic fields, this translates to the change in energy of the fields being equal to the energy added to the system minus the work done by the fields.



### Subsection 1.2b: Poynting Theorem



The Poynting theorem is a fundamental equation in electromagnetism that relates the flow of energy in electromagnetic fields to the sources of those fields. It is named after John Henry Poynting, who first derived the equation in 1884.



The Poynting theorem states that the rate of change of energy in a given volume is equal to the negative of the divergence of the Poynting vector, which represents the flow of energy per unit area. This theorem is a direct consequence of Maxwell's equations and provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields.



### Subsection 1.2c: Applications of Energy Conservation and the Poynting Theorem



The conservation of energy and the Poynting theorem have numerous applications in the field of electromagnetism. They are used to analyze and predict the behavior of electromagnetic waves, such as light and radio waves, and to design and optimize devices that utilize these waves.



One example of the application of energy conservation and the Poynting theorem is in the design of solar panels. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity by utilizing the photoelectric effect. The Poynting theorem can be used to calculate the amount of energy that can be harvested from the sunlight and the efficiency of the solar panel in converting that energy into electricity.



In conclusion, the conservation of energy and the Poynting theorem are essential concepts in electromagnetism that have numerous applications in various fields. Understanding these principles is crucial for further exploration of Maxwell's equations and their implications in modern physics.

The conservation of energy and the Poynting theorem have numerous applications in the field of electromagnetism. They are used to analyze and predict the behavior of electromagnetic fields in a variety of systems, including antennas, transmission lines, and optical fibers.



One important application of the Poynting theorem is in the study of electromagnetic waves. The Poynting vector can be used to calculate the intensity of an electromagnetic wave, which is the amount of energy passing through a unit area per unit time. This allows us to understand how electromagnetic waves propagate and interact with different materials.



Another important application of energy conservation and the Poynting theorem is in the design and analysis of electrical circuits. By applying the Poynting theorem, we can determine the power dissipated in different components of a circuit and ensure that energy is conserved throughout the system.



In addition, the Poynting theorem has been used to study the behavior of electromagnetic fields in biological systems. By understanding how energy is transferred and conserved in these systems, we can gain insights into the functioning of living organisms and potentially develop new medical technologies.



### Subsection 1.2d: Conclusion



In this section, we have explored the concept of conservation laws in the context of electromagnetic theory. We have seen how the conservation of energy and the Poynting theorem play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields and have numerous applications in various fields of study.

### Section 1.2: Conservation Laws: Energy, Poynting Theorem



In this section, we will explore the concept of conservation laws in the context of electromagnetic theory. Specifically, we will focus on the conservation of energy and the Poynting theorem, which relates the flow of energy in electromagnetic fields.



### Subsection 1.2c: Energy Flow in Electromagnetic Fields



In the previous subsections, we discussed the fundamental principles of energy conservation and the Poynting theorem. Now, we will apply these concepts to understand the flow of energy in electromagnetic fields.



The Poynting theorem states that the rate of change of energy in a given volume is equal to the negative of the divergence of the Poynting vector, which represents the flow of energy per unit area. This means that the energy in a given volume can either increase or decrease depending on the direction and magnitude of the Poynting vector.



To better understand this, let's consider a simple example of a parallel plate capacitor. When a voltage is applied to the capacitor, an electric field is created between the plates. This electric field stores energy in the form of electric potential energy. As the capacitor discharges, the electric field decreases and the energy is released in the form of electromagnetic waves.



According to the Poynting theorem, the energy flow in this system is given by the Poynting vector, which is proportional to the cross product of the electric and magnetic fields. As the electric field decreases, the Poynting vector points away from the capacitor, indicating the flow of energy away from the system. This energy is then transferred to the surrounding space in the form of electromagnetic waves.



Similarly, in the case of a circuit with an inductor, the energy is stored in the form of magnetic field energy. As the current in the circuit changes, the magnetic field also changes, resulting in a Poynting vector that points away from the inductor, indicating the flow of energy away from the system.



In both of these examples, we can see how the Poynting theorem and the concept of energy conservation are closely related. The Poynting vector tells us the direction and magnitude of the energy flow, while the conservation of energy ensures that the total energy in the system remains constant.



### Conclusion



In this section, we have explored the concept of energy flow in electromagnetic fields and how it relates to the principles of energy conservation and the Poynting theorem. These concepts are fundamental to understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields and have numerous applications in various fields of science and engineering. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formulation of these concepts through Maxwell's equations.

### Section 1.3: Conservation Laws: Momentum, Stress Tensor



In the previous section, we discussed the conservation laws of energy and the Poynting theorem. In this section, we will explore the conservation laws of momentum and the stress tensor in the context of electromagnetic theory.



### Subsection 1.3a: Momentum Conservation in Electromagnetic Theory



In classical mechanics, momentum is defined as the product of mass and velocity. However, in the context of electromagnetic theory, momentum takes on a different form. It is now described as the momentum density, which is the product of the electric and magnetic fields.



To understand this concept, let's consider a charged particle moving through a uniform magnetic field. The particle will experience a force perpendicular to its velocity, causing it to move in a circular path. This circular motion is a result of the momentum of the particle, which is given by the product of its charge and velocity.



In electromagnetic theory, the momentum of a charged particle is described by the Poynting vector, which represents the flow of energy per unit area. This vector is also proportional to the cross product of the electric and magnetic fields, similar to the Poynting vector in the Poynting theorem.



The conservation of momentum in electromagnetic theory is described by Maxwell's equations. These equations state that the change in momentum of a system is equal to the force acting on the system. This force is a result of the interaction between electric and magnetic fields, and it is responsible for the motion of charged particles.



In addition to momentum conservation, the stress tensor is also an important concept in electromagnetic theory. The stress tensor describes the distribution of forces within a system, and it is crucial in understanding the behavior of materials under electromagnetic fields.



The stress tensor is derived from the Maxwell stress tensor, which is a mathematical representation of the forces acting on a surface due to electromagnetic fields. This tensor is a key component in the study of materials such as dielectrics and conductors, as it helps us understand how these materials respond to external electromagnetic forces.



In conclusion, the conservation laws of momentum and the stress tensor play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields and their interactions with matter. These concepts are essential for further exploration of Maxwell's equations and their applications in various fields of physics and engineering.

In addition to momentum conservation, the stress tensor is also an important concept in electromagnetic theory. The stress tensor describes the distribution of forces within a system, and it is crucial in understanding the behavior of materials under electromagnetic fields.



### Subsection 1.3b: Stress Tensor and its Role



The stress tensor, denoted by $\sigma$, is a mathematical representation of the forces acting on a material. It is a second-order tensor, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. In the context of electromagnetic theory, the stress tensor describes the distribution of forces caused by the interaction between electric and magnetic fields.



To better understand the role of the stress tensor, let's consider a simple example. Imagine a charged particle moving through a uniform electric field. The electric field exerts a force on the particle, causing it to accelerate. This acceleration creates a stress on the particle, which is represented by the stress tensor.



The stress tensor is also crucial in understanding the behavior of materials under electromagnetic fields. When a material is placed in an electric or magnetic field, the stress tensor describes the distribution of forces within the material. This is important in predicting how the material will respond to the applied field, such as whether it will deform or break.



Furthermore, the stress tensor is related to the strain tensor, which describes the deformation of a material. In the context of electromagnetic theory, the strain tensor is caused by the interaction between electric and magnetic fields. This relationship between the stress and strain tensors is known as the constitutive relation, and it is an essential concept in understanding the behavior of materials under electromagnetic fields.



In conclusion, the stress tensor plays a crucial role in electromagnetic theory, describing the distribution of forces within a system and its relationship to the strain tensor. It is an essential concept in understanding the behavior of materials under electromagnetic fields and is a fundamental component of Maxwell's equations.

In electromagnetic theory, the momentum of a charged particle is described by the Poynting vector, which represents the flow of energy per unit area. This vector is also proportional to the cross product of the electric and magnetic fields, similar to the Poynting vector in the Poynting theorem.



The conservation of momentum in electromagnetic theory is described by Maxwell's equations. These equations state that the change in momentum of a system is equal to the force acting on the system. This force is a result of the interaction between electric and magnetic fields, and it is responsible for the motion of charged particles.



In addition to momentum conservation, the stress tensor is also an important concept in electromagnetic theory. The stress tensor describes the distribution of forces within a system, and it is crucial in understanding the behavior of materials under electromagnetic fields.



### Subsection 1.3b: Stress Tensor and its Role



The stress tensor is a mathematical representation of the forces acting on a material in an electromagnetic field. It is a second-order tensor that describes the distribution of forces in three dimensions. The stress tensor is an essential tool in understanding the behavior of materials under electromagnetic fields.



In the context of electromagnetic theory, the stress tensor is derived from the Maxwell stress tensor, which is a combination of the electric and magnetic fields. The Maxwell stress tensor describes the forces acting on a material due to the electric and magnetic fields, and it is a crucial component in the conservation of momentum.



The stress tensor plays a significant role in the study of materials under electromagnetic fields. It allows us to understand how materials respond to different types of forces and how they behave under different conditions. This understanding is essential in the design and development of new materials for various applications.



### Subsection 1.3c: Applications of Momentum Conservation



The conservation of momentum in electromagnetic theory has many practical applications. One of the most significant applications is in the field of electromagnetics, where it is used to design and analyze electromagnetic devices such as antennas, motors, and generators.



In the design of antennas, momentum conservation is crucial in understanding the radiation pattern and efficiency of the antenna. By conserving momentum, we can determine the direction and strength of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the antenna.



In motors and generators, momentum conservation is essential in understanding the forces acting on the moving parts and the efficiency of the device. By conserving momentum, we can optimize the design of these devices to improve their performance.



Overall, the conservation of momentum in electromagnetic theory has a wide range of applications and is a fundamental concept in understanding the behavior of materials and devices under electromagnetic fields.

### Section 1.4: Energy and Momentum of E&M Waves



In the previous section, we discussed the conservation laws of energy and momentum in the context of electromagnetic theory. In this section, we will explore the energy and momentum of electromagnetic waves, which are fundamental to understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields.



### Subsection 1.4a: Energy of Electromagnetic Waves



Electromagnetic waves are a form of energy that propagate through space. They are created by the oscillation of electric and magnetic fields, and they can travel through vacuum or matter. The energy of an electromagnetic wave is described by the Poynting vector, which represents the flow of energy per unit area.



To understand the energy of electromagnetic waves, let's consider a simple example of a radio wave. As the radio wave travels through space, it carries energy from the transmitter to the receiver. This energy is transferred through the oscillation of electric and magnetic fields, and it is described by the Poynting vector.



In mathematical terms, the Poynting vector is given by the cross product of the electric and magnetic fields, and it is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave. This means that the energy of an electromagnetic wave is directly related to the strength of the electric and magnetic fields.



### Subsection 1.4b: Momentum of Electromagnetic Waves



In classical mechanics, momentum is defined as the product of mass and velocity. However, in the context of electromagnetic theory, momentum takes on a different form. It is now described as the momentum density, which is the product of the electric and magnetic fields.



To understand this concept, let's consider a beam of light traveling through space. As the light beam propagates, it carries momentum in the direction of its propagation. This momentum is described by the Poynting vector, which is proportional to the cross product of the electric and magnetic fields.



In mathematical terms, the Poynting vector can be written as the product of the electric and magnetic fields, and it is proportional to the wave vector of the electromagnetic wave. This means that the momentum of an electromagnetic wave is directly related to the direction and wavelength of the wave.



### Subsection 1.4c: Conservation of Energy and Momentum in Electromagnetic Waves



Just like in classical mechanics, energy and momentum are conserved in electromagnetic waves. This means that the total energy and momentum of an electromagnetic wave remain constant as it propagates through space.



In mathematical terms, this conservation is described by Maxwell's equations, which state that the change in energy and momentum of a system is equal to the force acting on the system. In the case of electromagnetic waves, this force is a result of the interaction between electric and magnetic fields.



Furthermore, the stress tensor plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of materials under electromagnetic fields. It describes the distribution of forces within a system, and it is directly related to the energy and momentum of electromagnetic waves.



### Conclusion



In this section, we have explored the energy and momentum of electromagnetic waves. We have seen how the Poynting vector describes the flow of energy and momentum in these waves, and how they are conserved through the interaction of electric and magnetic fields. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of electromagnetic waves and their behavior in different materials.

This energy is transferred through the oscillation of electric and magnetic fields, and it is described by the Poynting vector.



In mathematical terms, the Poynting vector is given by the equation:



$$
\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}
$$



where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, and $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field. This equation shows that the energy of an electromagnetic wave is directly related to the strength of the electric and magnetic fields.



### Subsection 1.4b: Momentum of Electromagnetic Waves



In classical mechanics, momentum is defined as the product of mass and velocity. However, in the context of electromagnetic theory, momentum takes on a different form. It is now described as the momentum density, which is the product of the electric and magnetic fields.

This momentum is described by the Poynting vector, which is proportional to the cross product of the electric and magnetic fields.



In mathematical terms, the momentum density is given by the equation:



$$
\mathbf{p} = \frac{1}{c^2} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}
$$



where $c$ is the speed of light. This equation shows that the momentum of an electromagnetic wave is directly related to the strength of the electric and magnetic fields, and it is inversely proportional to the speed of light.



In conclusion, the energy and momentum of electromagnetic waves are fundamental concepts in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields. The Poynting vector and the momentum density provide a mathematical description of these concepts and show the direct relationship between the strength of the electric and magnetic fields and the energy and momentum of electromagnetic waves. 





### Subsection 1.4c: Interaction of E&M Waves with Matter



In the previous subsections, we discussed the energy and momentum of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum. However, in reality, electromagnetic waves often interact with matter, and this interaction can have significant consequences.



When an electromagnetic wave interacts with matter, it can cause the particles within the material to oscillate, creating their own electromagnetic fields. These fields can then interact with the original wave, leading to phenomena such as absorption, reflection, and refraction.



The interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter is described by the dielectric constant and magnetic permeability of the material. These properties determine how much the electric and magnetic fields are affected by the presence of the material.



In general, the dielectric constant and magnetic permeability are complex numbers, meaning they have both real and imaginary components. The real component represents the material's ability to store energy, while the imaginary component represents the material's ability to dissipate energy.



The complex nature of these properties is crucial in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves in matter. For example, in a material with a high dielectric constant, the electric field of an electromagnetic wave will be significantly reduced, while the magnetic field will remain relatively unchanged. This difference in the behavior of the electric and magnetic fields can lead to interesting phenomena, such as the phenomenon of total internal reflection.



In addition to affecting the fields of an electromagnetic wave, the interaction with matter can also affect the wave's energy and momentum. When an electromagnetic wave is absorbed by a material, its energy is transferred to the particles within the material, causing them to vibrate and generate their own electromagnetic fields. This transfer of energy can also lead to a transfer of momentum, as the particles within the material are set into motion.



Understanding the interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter is crucial in many applications, such as in the design of electronic devices and the study of materials. It allows us to manipulate and control the behavior of electromagnetic waves, leading to advancements in technology and a deeper understanding of the world around us. 





### Conclusion

These equations describe the relationship between electric and magnetic fields, and how they interact with each other and with charged particles. We have seen how these equations were developed by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century, and how they have been refined and expanded upon by other scientists over the years.

## Chapter: - Chapter 2: Models of Electric Response:



### Introduction



In this chapter, we will explore the various models of electric response that are used in electromagnetic theory. These models are essential in understanding the behavior of electric fields and their interactions with matter. We will begin by discussing the basic principles of electric response and how it relates to the fundamental laws of electromagnetism. From there, we will delve into more complex models, such as the Drude model and the Lorentz model, which are used to describe the behavior of conductors and dielectrics, respectively.



One of the key concepts in electric response is the concept of polarization. We will explore how polarization arises in different materials and how it affects the overall behavior of electric fields. We will also discuss the concept of permittivity, which is a measure of a material's ability to store electric charge. This will lead us to the study of dielectric materials and their role in electric response.



Another important aspect of electric response is the study of conductors. We will examine the behavior of electric fields in conductors and how it differs from that of dielectric materials. We will also discuss the concept of conductivity and its relationship to the electric field. This will lead us to the Drude model, which is used to describe the behavior of conductors in the presence of an electric field.



Finally, we will explore the Lorentz model, which is used to describe the behavior of dielectric materials. This model takes into account the polarizability of materials and how it affects the overall response to an electric field. We will also discuss the concept of dispersion, which is the variation of a material's refractive index with frequency, and its role in the Lorentz model.



By the end of this chapter, you will have a thorough understanding of the different models of electric response and how they are used to describe the behavior of electric fields in different materials. This knowledge will be essential in furthering your understanding of electromagnetic theory and its applications in various fields. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of electric response models.

### Section 2.1: Frequency-dependent Response Function, Kramers-Kronig Theorem:



In the previous chapter, we discussed the basic principles of electric response and how it relates to the fundamental laws of electromagnetism. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of frequency-dependent response and its importance in understanding the behavior of electric fields.



#### Subsection 2.1a: Frequency-dependent Response in Materials



In many experimental configurations, there are explicit expressions relating the shifts of frequency and bandwidth to the sample properties. These expressions are based on the assumptions underlying the equations, which we will discuss in this subsection.



One of the key assumptions is that of a semi-infinite viscoelastic medium. This means that the medium is infinite in one direction, but has a finite thickness in the other direction. In this case, we can use the following equations to describe the frequency-dependent response:



$$\frac{\Delta f^{*}}{f_f}=\frac i{\pi Z_q}\,\frac \sigma {\dot{u}}=\frac

i{\pi Z_q}Z_{\mathrm{ac}}=\frac i{\pi Z_q}\sqrt{\rho i\omega \eta }$$


Here, $\eta'$ and $\eta''$ are the real and imaginary parts of the viscosity, respectively. $Z_{ac} = \rho c = (\rho G)^{1/2}$ is the acoustic impedance of the medium, where $\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $G = i\omega\eta$ is the shear modulus.



For Newtonian liquids, where $\eta'$ is constant and $\eta'' = 0$, the shifts in frequency and bandwidth are equal and opposite and scale as the square root of the overtone order, $n^{1/2}$. However, for viscoelastic liquids, where $\eta'$ is a function of frequency and $\eta'' \neq 0$, we can obtain the complex viscosity using the following equations:


$$\eta'=-\frac{\pi Z_q^2}{\rho_{Liq}\,f}\,\frac{\Delta f\Delta (w/2)}{f_f^2}$$

$$\eta''=\frac 12\frac{\pi Z_q^2}{\rho_{Liq}\,f}\,\frac{((\Delta (w/2))^2-\Delta f^2)}{f_f^2}$$


It is important to note that the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) only probes the region close to the crystal surface. The shear wave evanescently decays into the liquid, with a penetration depth of about 250 nm at 5 MHz in water. This means that surface roughness, nano-bubbles at the surface, slip, and compressional waves can interfere with the measurement of viscosity.



Furthermore, the viscosity determined at MHz frequencies may differ from the low-frequency viscosity. This is where torsional resonators, with a frequency around 100 kHz, come into play as they are closer to the low-frequency range.



In conclusion, the frequency-dependent response in materials is a crucial aspect of understanding the behavior of electric fields. By making certain assumptions and using the appropriate equations, we can obtain valuable information about the properties of the material being studied. In the next section, we will explore the Kramers-Kronig theorem, which provides a powerful tool for analyzing the frequency-dependent response of materials.

### Section 2.1: Frequency-dependent Response Function, Kramers-Kronig Theorem:



In the previous chapter, we discussed the basic principles of electric response and how it relates to the fundamental laws of electromagnetism. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of frequency-dependent response and its importance in understanding the behavior of electric fields.



#### Subsection 2.1a: Frequency-dependent Response in Materials



In many experimental configurations, there are explicit expressions relating the shifts of frequency and bandwidth to the sample properties. These expressions are based on the assumptions underlying the equations, which we will discuss in this subsection.



One of the key assumptions is that of a semi-infinite viscoelastic medium. This means that the medium is infinite in one direction, but has a finite thickness in the other direction. In this case, we can use the following equations to describe the frequency-dependent response:


$$\frac{\Delta f^{*}}{f_f}=\frac i{\pi Z_q}\,\frac \sigma {\dot{u}}=\frac

i{\pi Z_q}Z_{\mathrm{ac}}=\frac i{\pi Z_q}\sqrt{\rho i\omega \eta }$$


Here, $\eta'$ and $\eta''$ are the real and imaginary parts of the viscosity, respectively. $Z_{ac} = \rho c = (\rho G)^{1/2}$ is the acoustic impedance of the medium, where $\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $G = i\omega\eta$ is the shear modulus.



For Newtonian liquids, where $\eta'$ is constant and $\eta'' = 0$, the shifts in frequency and bandwidth are equal and opposite and scale as the square root of the overtone order, $n^{1/2}$. However, for viscoelastic liquids, where $\eta'$ is a function of frequency and $\eta'' \neq 0$, we can obtain the complex viscosity using the following equations:


$$\eta'=-\frac{\pi Z_q^2}{\rho_{Liq}\,f}\,\frac{\Delta f\Delta (w/2)}{f_f^2}$$

$$\eta''=\frac 12\frac{\pi Z_q^2}{\rho_{Liq}\,f}\,\frac{((\Delta (w/2))^2-\Delta f^2)}{f_f^2}$$



These equations are based on the Kramers-Kronig theorem, which states that the real and imaginary parts of a complex function are related through a Hilbert transform. In the case of viscoelastic materials, this theorem allows us to relate the frequency-dependent response to the complex viscosity of the material.



The Kramers-Kronig theorem has important implications for the behavior of electric fields in materials. It tells us that the response of a material to an electric field at a certain frequency is not only dependent on that frequency, but also on all other frequencies. This means that the response of a material is not just a simple linear relationship, but rather a complex function that takes into account the entire frequency spectrum.



This has significant implications for the design and understanding of electronic devices and materials. By considering the frequency-dependent response, we can better predict and control the behavior of electric fields in materials, leading to more efficient and effective technologies.



In the next section, we will discuss the Pawula theorem, which further expands on the implications of the Kramers-Kronig theorem and its applications in various fields of study.
