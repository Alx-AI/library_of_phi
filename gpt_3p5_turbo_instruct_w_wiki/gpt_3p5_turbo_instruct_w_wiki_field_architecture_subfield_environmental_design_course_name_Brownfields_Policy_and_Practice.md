# Brownfields Policy and Practice: A Comprehensive Guide to Urban Redevelopment":





## Foreward



Welcome to "Brownfields Policy and Practice: A Comprehensive Guide to Urban Redevelopment". This book aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the policies and practices surrounding the redevelopment of brownfields, with a focus on promoting sustainable land use and remediation.



As our society continues to grow and develop, the demand for land and resources increases. However, this growth often comes at a cost to the environment and future generations. This is where the concept of sustainability comes into play. By recycling and reusing previously abandoned and unused land, we can promote smart growth and responsible development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.



The benefits of land recycling go beyond just environmental sustainability. As most brownfields and abandoned sites are located in urban areas, their redevelopment taps into existing infrastructure, reducing the need for new roads and amenities. This not only saves resources but also prevents sprawl into open spaces, forests, and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.



In this book, we will delve into the various public policies and private decisions that affect the redevelopment of brownfields. We will analyze critical factors, relative weights, and areal differentials to understand the complexities of this process. Additionally, we will explore the concept of sustainable land remediation and planning, which takes a holistic approach to land remediation by considering not just the current environmental implications but also the long-term social and economic impacts.



One key aspect of sustainable land remediation is co-design, which involves engaging in more inclusive conversations with stakeholders and completing cost-benefit analyses to find the most effective solutions. We will also examine the role of the Society of American Military Engineers in promoting sustainable practices through policy implementation by the American Department of Defense.



I hope this book serves as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in the field of urban redevelopment and sustainable land use. By understanding the policies and practices surrounding brownfields, we can work towards creating a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

Urban sprawl can lead to the abandonment of older industrial and commercial properties, as businesses move to newer developments on the outskirts of cities.



#### 2.1a Definition of Brownfields



The term "brownfields" was first used in 1992 at a U.S. congressional field hearing, and it has since been defined and used in various ways by different governments and organizations. In Canada, brownfields are defined as "abandoned, idle or underutilized commercial or industrial properties [typically located in urban areas] where past actions have caused environmental contamination, but which still have potential for redevelopment or other economic opportunities." This definition highlights the potential for these properties to be revitalized and put to productive use.



In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines brownfields as properties that may have been previously improved but have impediments, such as the presence or potential presence of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. This definition aligns with a more general definition of brownfields as industrial or commercial properties that require cleanup and redevelopment. The EPA's brownfields program, which began in the 1990s, has been successful in addressing these properties and making them ready for reuse.



#### 2.1b Characteristics of Brownfields



Brownfields can vary in size and type, but they share some common characteristics. These properties are often located in urban areas and may have been previously used for industrial or commercial purposes. They may also have been abandoned or underutilized for a significant period, leading to deterioration and potential contamination. Brownfields can also be found in areas that have experienced urban sprawl, as businesses move to newer developments and leave behind older properties.



#### 2.1c Risks Associated with Brownfields



The presence of hazardous substances and contaminants on brownfield sites can pose significant risks to human health and the environment. These substances can leach into the soil and groundwater, potentially contaminating nearby water sources and posing a threat to public health.

The EPA's brownfields program, which began in the 1990s, has been successful in addressing these properties and making them ready for reuse.



#### 2.1b Characteristics of Brownfields



Brownfields can vary in size and type, but they share some common characteristics. These properties are often located in urban areas and may have been previously used for industrial or commercial purposes. They may also have been abandoned due to economic downturns or changes in industry, leaving behind contaminated land and buildings. Brownfields can also be found in areas that have experienced urban sprawl, as businesses move to newer developments and leave behind older properties. These properties may have environmental contamination from past industrial or commercial activities, making them unsuitable for immediate redevelopment.



### Subsection: 2.1b Urban Sprawl and Its Impact



Urban sprawl is a phenomenon that has been occurring for decades, as cities continue to expand and develop into previously undeveloped land. This type of development has significant impacts on the environment, economy, and society. One of the major impacts of urban sprawl is the abandonment of older properties, leading to the creation of brownfields.



As businesses move to newer developments on the outskirts of cities, they leave behind older properties that may no longer be economically viable. This can lead to the abandonment of industrial and commercial properties, which may have been contaminated during their use. As a result, these properties become brownfields, posing health and environmental risks to nearby communities.



Urban sprawl also has a significant impact on the environment. As cities expand, they encroach on natural habitats and green spaces, leading to loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystems. This can also contribute to air and water pollution, as well as increased carbon emissions from increased transportation needs.



In addition, urban sprawl can have negative impacts on society. As cities expand, they become more spread out, leading to longer commutes and increased reliance on cars. This can contribute to traffic congestion, air pollution, and decreased physical activity. It can also lead to social isolation and a lack of community cohesion.



Overall, urban sprawl has significant impacts on the environment, economy, and society, and it is closely linked to the creation of brownfields. Understanding the relationship between urban sprawl and brownfields is crucial in developing effective policies and practices for urban redevelopment.

These properties are often located in urban areas and may have been previously used for industrial or commercial purposes. They may also have been abandoned due to economic downturns or changes in industry, leaving behind contaminated land and buildings. Brownfields can also be found in areas with high levels of urban sprawl, as businesses move to newer developments and leave behind older properties.



Brownfields are often characterized by environmental contamination, which can pose health risks to nearby communities. This contamination can come from a variety of sources, including industrial waste, chemical spills, and improper disposal of hazardous materials. The presence of contamination can make these properties difficult and costly to redevelop, as cleanup and remediation efforts are often necessary.



#### 2.1c Brownfields vs. Greenfields



In contrast to brownfields, greenfields refer to undeveloped land in urban or rural areas that have not been previously built on. These areas may be used for agriculture, landscaping, or left to evolve naturally. Greenfields offer developers a high degree of freedom, as they are not constrained by existing structures or infrastructure. However, developing on greenfields can also have negative impacts, such as urban sprawl and loss of natural habitats.



Brownfields and greenfields are often compared in the context of land recycling, which involves redeveloping abandoned or underutilized properties. While greenfields may offer more flexibility, brownfields have the potential for revitalization and can bring economic opportunities to urban areas. Additionally, redeveloping brownfields can help reduce urban sprawl and preserve green spaces.



In the next section, we will explore the process of redeveloping brownfields and the policies and practices involved in making these properties ready for reuse.





### Section: 2.2 Brownfield Redevelopment and Transportation Policy:



Brownfield redevelopment is a crucial aspect of urban revitalization, and transportation policy plays a significant role in this process. Transportation infrastructure, such as roads and highways, can have a significant impact on the redevelopment of brownfield sites. In this section, we will explore the role of transportation in brownfield redevelopment and how transportation policy can support sustainable and efficient urban development.



#### 2.2a Role of Transportation in Redevelopment



Transportation infrastructure is essential for the success of any urban development project, including brownfield redevelopment. Efficient transportation systems allow for the movement of people and goods, which is crucial for economic growth and development. However, transportation infrastructure can also have negative impacts on the environment and public health, especially in urban areas.



One of the main challenges in brownfield redevelopment is the location of these sites. Brownfields are often located in urban areas that have experienced urban sprawl, which can lead to the abandonment of older industrial and commercial properties. This can result in a concentration of brownfield sites in certain areas, making it difficult to access these sites without proper transportation infrastructure.



Moreover, transportation infrastructure can also contribute to the contamination of brownfield sites. For example, roadways and highways can act as barriers, preventing the natural flow of water and causing pollutants to accumulate in certain areas. This can lead to the contamination of nearby brownfield sites, making them more challenging to remediate and redevelop.



To address these challenges, transportation policy must consider the impact of transportation infrastructure on brownfield sites and prioritize sustainable and efficient development. This can include measures such as promoting public transportation and alternative modes of transportation, such as biking and walking, to reduce the reliance on personal vehicles. Additionally, transportation policy can also incorporate green infrastructure, such as permeable pavements and green roofs, to mitigate the negative impacts of transportation on brownfield sites.



In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainable and smart transportation policies that prioritize the use of renewable energy sources and promote energy efficiency. These policies not only reduce the environmental impact of transportation but also support the redevelopment of brownfield sites by providing sustainable and efficient transportation options.



In conclusion, transportation policy plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. By prioritizing sustainable and efficient transportation infrastructure, we can support the revitalization of brownfield sites and promote sustainable urban development.

This can include measures such as promoting public transportation and alternative modes of transportation, such as biking and walking, to reduce the reliance on personal vehicles. Additionally, transportation policy should also prioritize the remediation and redevelopment of brownfield sites in areas with existing transportation infrastructure to reduce the need for new infrastructure and minimize the impact on the environment.



#### 2.2b Transportation Policies Affecting Brownfields



Transportation policies can have a significant impact on the redevelopment of brownfield sites. One of the most significant policies affecting brownfields is the allocation of funding for transportation infrastructure projects. The United States invests 0.6% of its GDP on transportation annually, and this funding can be directed towards the remediation and redevelopment of brownfield sites. By prioritizing brownfield redevelopment in transportation funding, policymakers can support the revitalization of urban areas and promote sustainable development.



Another transportation policy that can affect brownfield redevelopment is the promotion of public transportation. As mentioned earlier, promoting alternative modes of transportation can reduce the reliance on personal vehicles and minimize the impact of transportation infrastructure on brownfield sites. This can also lead to a more efficient use of land and reduce urban sprawl, making it easier to access and redevelop brownfield sites.



Furthermore, transportation policies can also address the environmental impacts of transportation on brownfield sites. For instance, policies that promote the use of biofuels and alternative energy sources can reduce the carbon dioxide emissions from transportation, which is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. This can help mitigate the negative environmental impacts of transportation on brownfield sites and promote sustainable development.



In conclusion, transportation policy plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. By considering the impact of transportation infrastructure on brownfield sites and prioritizing sustainable and efficient development, policymakers can support the revitalization of urban areas and promote the reuse of contaminated land. Additionally, transportation policies can also address the environmental impacts of transportation on brownfield sites and promote sustainable development for the future. 





### Section: 2.2 Brownfield Redevelopment and Transportation Policy:



Brownfield redevelopment is a crucial aspect of urban revitalization, and transportation policy plays a significant role in this process. Transportation infrastructure, such as roads and highways, can have a significant impact on the redevelopment of brownfield sites. In this section, we will explore the role of transportation in brownfield redevelopment and how transportation policy can support sustainable and efficient urban development.

One of the main challenges in brownfield redevelopment is the location of these sites. Brownfields are often located in urban areas that have experienced urban sprawl, which can lead to the abandonment of older industrial and commercial properties. This can result in a concentration of brownfield sites in certain areas, making it difficult to access these sites without proper transportation infrastructure.



Moreover, transportation infrastructure can also contribute to the contamination of brownfield sites. For example, roadways and highways can act as barriers, preventing the natural flow of water and causing pollutants to accumulate in certain areas. This can lead to the contamination of nearby brownfield sites, making them more challenging to remediate and redevelop.



To address these challenges, transportation policy must consider the impact of transportation infrastructure on brownfield sites and prioritize sustainable and efficient development. This can include measures such as promoting public transportation and alternative modes of transportation, such as biking and walking, to reduce the reliance on personal vehicles. Additionally, transportation policy can also incorporate green infrastructure, such as permeable pavements and green roofs, to mitigate the negative impacts of transportation on brownfield sites.



#### 2.2b Case Studies of Transportation and Redevelopment



To further understand the relationship between transportation policy and brownfield redevelopment, let's examine some case studies of successful projects that have integrated transportation and redevelopment.



One example is the redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Baltimore, Maryland. This brownfield site was transformed into a mixed-use development that includes residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The project also incorporated a light rail station, providing convenient access to public transportation for residents and visitors.



Another case study is the redevelopment of the former Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. This brownfield site was transformed into a sustainable community with a focus on walkability and alternative modes of transportation. The development includes a network of bike paths and pedestrian-friendly streets, reducing the reliance on personal vehicles.



These case studies demonstrate the importance of considering transportation in brownfield redevelopment and the potential for successful integration of transportation and sustainable development.

### Section: 3.1 How We Got Here: Law and Liability:



The history of brownfields legislation in the United States can be traced back to the early 20th century, when industrialization and urbanization led to the development of contaminated sites in cities across the country. These sites, often abandoned or underutilized, posed significant environmental and health risks to surrounding communities.



In response to these issues, the federal government passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) in 1980. This law, also known as Superfund, established a program for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and provided a legal framework for holding responsible parties liable for the costs of remediation.



However, CERCLA was not specifically designed to address brownfields, and its strict liability provisions made it difficult for developers to take on the risk of redeveloping contaminated properties. This led to the passage of the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act in 2002.



This act, also known as the Brownfields Law, provided liability protections for innocent landowners and bona fide prospective purchasers of contaminated properties. It also established a grant program to provide funding for brownfields assessment, cleanup, and job training. These provisions helped to incentivize the redevelopment of brownfields and promote economic revitalization in urban areas.



In addition to federal legislation, many states have also passed their own brownfields laws and regulations. These laws vary in their scope and requirements, but they generally aim to provide liability protections and financial incentives for brownfields redevelopment.



The legal framework for brownfields redevelopment also includes local laws and regulations, which can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction. Some cities have established brownfields programs to provide technical assistance and financial incentives for redevelopment, while others have zoning ordinances that restrict the use of contaminated properties.



Overall, the legal framework for brownfields redevelopment is complex and multifaceted, involving federal, state, and local laws and regulations. This framework has evolved over time to address the challenges and opportunities presented by brownfields, and it continues to be a critical factor in promoting sustainable and equitable urban redevelopment.

In addition to federal legislation, many states have also passed their own brownfields laws and regulations. These laws vary in their scope and requirements, but they generally aim to provide liability protections and financial incentives for brownfields redevelopment.



The legal framework for brownfields redevelopment also includes local laws and regulations, which can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction. Some cities have established brownfields programs to provide technical assistance and financial incentives for redevelopment. These programs often involve public-private partnerships and community engagement to turn dilapidated properties into viable economic redevelopments or green spaces.



One key aspect of brownfields redevelopment is liability. Liability in brownfields redevelopment refers to the legal responsibility for any contamination on a property and the costs associated with remediation. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act provides liability protections for innocent landowners and bona fide prospective purchasers, making it easier for them to take on the risk of redeveloping contaminated properties.



To qualify for liability protections, landowners must conduct an "all appropriate inquiry" to determine the nature of the land's previous use. This includes asking previous owners about any potential contamination and taking steps to protect human health and the environment from the contamination. The act also requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make any contamination on the property publicly available within two years of discovery.



Funding for brownfields revitalization is also an important aspect of the legal framework. The Brownfields Law established a grant program that provides $250 million per year for brownfields assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training. This funding is distributed through the EPA's Brownfields Program, which works with other federal partners and state agencies to identify and leverage resources for brownfields activities.



The criteria for funding include protecting human health and the environment, promoting redevelopment and job creation, preserving open space and parks, and addressing sensitive populations. This funding is also intended to be distributed fairly between urban and rural areas and involve the local community in the redevelopment process.



Overall, the legal framework for brownfields redevelopment has evolved over time to address the unique challenges of redeveloping contaminated properties. Through liability protections and funding opportunities, the government has incentivized the cleanup and revitalization of brownfields, leading to economic growth and improved environmental and public health outcomes in urban areas.

The legal framework for brownfields redevelopment also includes local laws and regulations, which can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction. Some cities have established brownfields programs to provide technical assistance and financial incentives for redevelopment, while others have implemented stricter regulations for the cleanup and redevelopment of contaminated sites.



One key aspect of the legal framework for brownfields redevelopment is the concept of liability. Under CERCLA, liability for the costs of remediation falls on the current owner or operator of a contaminated property, as well as any previous owners or operators who contributed to the contamination. This strict liability can make it difficult for developers to take on the risk of redeveloping brownfields, as they may be held responsible for the costs of cleanup even if they were not responsible for the contamination.



To address this issue, the Brownfields Law introduced the concept of "innocent landowners" and "bona fide prospective purchasers." These are individuals or entities who acquire contaminated properties without knowledge of the contamination and who take reasonable steps to address it. Under the Brownfields Law, these parties are not held liable for the costs of remediation, providing them with some protection against the risks of redeveloping brownfields.



The legal framework for brownfields redevelopment has evolved over time, with the goal of promoting the cleanup and reuse of contaminated properties while also protecting the interests of developers and communities. As we continue to address the challenges of urban redevelopment, it is important to understand the historical context and legal framework that have shaped our approach to brownfields.

## Chapter: Brownfields Policy and Practice: A Comprehensive Guide to Urban Redevelopment



### Introduction:



In this chapter, we will explore the role of market forces and opportunity drivers in the context of brownfields redevelopment. Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that are potentially contaminated, making them difficult to redevelop. However, with the right policies and practices in place, these properties can be transformed into valuable assets for urban communities. 



Market forces play a crucial role in the redevelopment of brownfields. The demand for land and property in urban areas is constantly changing, and this can create opportunities for brownfields redevelopment. For example, as cities grow and expand, there may be a need for new housing developments or commercial spaces. This demand can drive developers to look for available land, including brownfields, to meet the needs of the market. 



Opportunity drivers, such as government incentives and regulations, also play a significant role in brownfields redevelopment. Incentives, such as tax breaks or grants, can make it more financially feasible for developers to take on the risks associated with redeveloping brownfields. On the other hand, regulations, such as environmental laws and zoning ordinances, can create barriers or opportunities for brownfields redevelopment. Understanding these drivers and how they interact with market forces is crucial for successful brownfields redevelopment. 



In this chapter, we will delve into the various market forces and opportunity drivers that impact brownfields redevelopment. We will also discuss how these factors can be leveraged to create successful and sustainable redevelopment projects. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the complex dynamics at play in the brownfields redevelopment process.

## Chapter 4: Market Forces and Opportunity Drivers



### Section 4.1: Market Forces Influencing Brownfields Redevelopment



In this section, we will explore the various market forces that influence brownfields redevelopment. These forces are constantly changing and can create both challenges and opportunities for developers looking to redevelop brownfield sites.



One of the main market forces that drives brownfields redevelopment is the demand for land and property in urban areas. As cities grow and expand, there is a constant need for new housing developments, commercial spaces, and other types of development. This demand can create opportunities for developers to look for available land, including brownfields, to meet the needs of the market. Brownfields, with their central location and potential for redevelopment, can be attractive options for developers looking to capitalize on the demand for urban development.



Another market force that impacts brownfields redevelopment is the fluctuation of property values. The value of a brownfield site is often lower than that of a comparable undeveloped site due to the potential contamination and associated risks. However, as the demand for urban development increases, the value of brownfield sites can also increase. This can make it more financially feasible for developers to take on the risks associated with redeveloping brownfields.



In addition to market demand and property values, other economic factors also play a role in brownfields redevelopment. For example, the availability of financing and the cost of remediation can greatly impact the feasibility of a brownfield redevelopment project. Government incentives, such as tax breaks or grants, can help offset these costs and make it more financially viable for developers to take on brownfield projects.



However, economic factors can also create challenges for brownfields redevelopment. For instance, if the cost of remediation is too high or the market demand for development decreases, it may not be financially feasible for developers to take on a brownfield project. This can result in the site remaining abandoned or underutilized, further contributing to urban blight.



Understanding these market forces and how they interact with each other is crucial for successful brownfields redevelopment. Developers must carefully consider the economic factors at play and assess the potential risks and opportunities before embarking on a brownfield redevelopment project.



### Subsection 4.1a: Economic Factors in Redevelopment



As mentioned earlier, economic factors such as financing and remediation costs can greatly impact the feasibility of brownfields redevelopment. In this subsection, we will delve deeper into these economic factors and their role in the redevelopment process.



Financing is a crucial aspect of any development project, and brownfields redevelopment is no exception. The cost of acquiring a brownfield site, conducting environmental assessments, and remediating any contamination can be significant. This can make it challenging for developers to secure financing for brownfield projects, especially if the site is in a distressed or economically disadvantaged area.



To address this issue, various financing mechanisms have been developed to support brownfields redevelopment. These include tax increment financing, brownfield tax credits, and grants from government agencies. These financing options can help offset the costs associated with brownfields redevelopment and make it more financially feasible for developers.



Another economic factor to consider is the cost of remediation. The extent of contamination and the type of remediation required can greatly impact the overall cost of a brownfield project. In some cases, the cost of remediation may be too high for a developer to take on, making the project financially unfeasible. This is where government incentives, such as tax breaks or grants, can play a crucial role in making brownfields redevelopment financially viable.



In addition to financing and remediation costs, other economic factors such as property taxes, insurance, and operating costs must also be considered when evaluating the feasibility of a brownfield project. These costs can vary depending on the location and type of development, and developers must carefully assess them to ensure the project is financially sustainable in the long run.



In conclusion, economic factors play a significant role in brownfields redevelopment. Developers must carefully consider the various economic factors at play and assess the potential risks and opportunities before embarking on a brownfield project. Government incentives and financing mechanisms can help offset the costs associated with brownfields redevelopment and make it more financially feasible for developers to take on these projects.

Government incentives, such as tax breaks or grants, can help offset these costs and make it more financially viable for developers to take on brownfield projects.



However, economic factors can also create challenges for brownfields redevelopment. For instance, the private sector plays a significant role in the redevelopment of brownfield sites. Private companies, motivated by profit, often have the resources and expertise to take on these projects. However, their involvement can also lead to negative effects, such as prioritizing profit over rehabilitation efforts. This can be seen in the example of corporate-run prisons, where the main priority is profit rather than rehabilitation.



Despite these challenges, the private sector also brings valuable resources and expertise to brownfields redevelopment. They can provide the necessary funding and knowledge to successfully remediate and redevelop contaminated sites. Additionally, private companies may have a vested interest in the success of the project, as they will ultimately own or lease the property.



In conclusion, the role of the private sector is crucial in the market forces that influence brownfields redevelopment. While their involvement can bring both challenges and opportunities, their resources and expertise are essential in successfully revitalizing these abandoned and contaminated sites.

Private companies, motivated by profit, may be hesitant to take on the risks and costs associated with brownfield redevelopment. This can lead to a lack of interest and investment in these sites, making it difficult for them to be revitalized.



To address this challenge, public-private partnerships (PPPs) have emerged as a popular approach to brownfield redevelopment. PPPs involve collaboration between a public sector authority and a private sector consortium, typically formed for the specific purpose of providing the redevelopment. These partnerships can help mitigate the risks and costs associated with brownfield redevelopment by sharing responsibilities and resources between the public and private sectors.



One of the key benefits of PPPs is the ability to leverage private sector expertise and resources. Private companies often have the necessary technical knowledge and financial resources to successfully remediate and redevelop brownfield sites. By partnering with the public sector, these companies can access government incentives and support, making it more financially feasible for them to take on these projects.



PPPs also offer a way to address the complex legal and financial issues that often arise in brownfield redevelopment. The public sector can provide oversight and guidance, ensuring that the project is carried out in compliance with regulations and that the interests of the community are taken into account. This can help mitigate potential conflicts and delays that may arise in the redevelopment process.



In conclusion, market forces play a significant role in brownfields redevelopment. The demand for urban development, fluctuation of property values, and economic factors all influence the feasibility and success of these projects. Public-private partnerships offer a promising approach to addressing the challenges and leveraging the opportunities presented by these market forces. By working together, the public and private sectors can revitalize brownfield sites and contribute to the sustainable development of urban areas.

So, let's begin our tour of the City of Lynn and discover the innovative approaches used to transform brownfields into vibrant and productive spaces.





## Chapter 5: Site Tour: City of Lynn



### Section: 5.1 Overview of Lynn's Brownfields



The City of Lynn, located in Massachusetts, USA, has a rich history and has been an important industrial center for over a century. However, like many other cities in the United States, Lynn has faced challenges in dealing with abandoned and contaminated industrial sites, also known as brownfields. These sites pose a threat to public health and the environment, and their redevelopment is crucial for the revitalization of urban areas.



### Subsection: 5.1a History of Lynn's Industrial Sites



Lynn's industrial history dates back to the 19th century, when the city became a major shoe manufacturing center. The availability of skilled labor, access to raw materials, and a good port for shipping goods made Lynn an ideal location for shoe factories. As the shoe industry grew, so did the city's population and economy.



However, with the decline of the shoe industry in the mid-20th century, many factories were left abandoned and contaminated. The city also faced economic challenges, leading to a decline in population and a rise in unemployment. These abandoned industrial sites, or brownfields, became a major issue for the city.



In the 1980s, the City of Lynn recognized the need to address these brownfields and began implementing policies and practices to promote their redevelopment. The city worked closely with government agencies, community organizations, and private developers to identify and assess contaminated sites, and to develop strategies for their cleanup and reuse.



One of the major challenges faced by the city was the lack of funding for brownfield redevelopment. To overcome this, the city utilized various federal and state funding programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Program and the Massachusetts Brownfields Tax Credit Program. These programs provided financial assistance for site assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment, making it more feasible for private developers to invest in these properties.



Another challenge was the complex nature of brownfield sites, which often required a combination of cleanup methods.

# Environmental Justice and Equity



## Definitions



Environmental justice is a concept that has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in the field of urban redevelopment. It is typically defined as distributive justice, which is the equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits among all members of society. This includes considerations of race, income, and other social factors that may contribute to unequal exposure to environmental hazards. In addition to distributive justice, environmental justice also encompasses procedural justice, which is the fair and meaningful participation of all individuals in decision-making processes related to environmental issues. Finally, recognition justice is also a key aspect of environmental justice, which involves acknowledging and addressing the oppression and differences faced by marginalized communities in environmental decision-making.



The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as "the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies." This definition highlights the importance of ensuring that all individuals have equal access to environmental benefits and are not disproportionately burdened by environmental risks.



## Historical Context



The concept of environmental justice has its roots in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, when activists began to draw attention to the unequal distribution of environmental hazards in low-income and minority communities. This led to the formation of the environmental justice movement in the 1980s, which sought to address the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on marginalized communities. In 1994, President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which directed federal agencies to identify and address environmental justice issues in their programs and policies.

### Subsection 6.1c Case Studies in Environmental Justice



To better understand the impact of environmental justice on urban redevelopment, it is important to examine case studies from different countries. In Argentina, environmental justice movements have arisen from local conflicts, such as the struggle against the construction of a pulp mill in the town of Gualeguaychú. The local community, which is predominantly indigenous, raised concerns about the potential pollution of their water sources and the negative impact on their health and livelihoods.



Similarly, in Brazil, environmental justice movements have emerged from local conflicts, such as the struggle against the construction of the Belo Monte Dam in the Amazon rainforest. The indigenous communities living in the area have raised concerns about the displacement of their communities and the destruction of their land and resources.



In Ecuador, notable environmental justice movements have arisen from several local conflicts, including the struggle against oil drilling in the Amazon rainforest and the construction of a copper mine in the Intag region. These conflicts have highlighted the unequal distribution of environmental risks and benefits, as well as the lack of meaningful participation of local communities in decision-making processes.



In Peru, environmental conflicts have also been a major issue, particularly in the mining sector. Notable conflicts include the Conga mine project in Cajamarca and the Tía María mine project in Arequipa. These conflicts have brought attention to the disproportionate impact of mining on indigenous communities and the lack of recognition of their rights to a healthy and safe environment.



## Relationships to other movements and philosophies



### Climate justice



Climate change and climate justice have also been a component when discussing environmental justice and the greater impact it has on environmental justice communities. Air pollution and water pollution are two contributors of climate change that can have detrimental effects such as extreme temperatures, increase in precipitation, and a rise in sea level. Because of this, communities are more vulnerable to events including floods and droughts potentially resulting in food scarcity and an increased exposure to infectious, food-related, and water-related diseases. Currently, without sufficient treatment, more than 80% of all wastewater generated globally is released into the environment. High-income nations treat, on average, 70% of the wastewater they produce, according to UN Water.



It has been projected that climate change will have the greatest impact on vulnerable populations, including those in low-income and minority communities. This highlights the intersectionality of environmental justice and climate justice, as these communities are often the most affected by both environmental hazards and the impacts of climate change.



Climate justice has been influenced by environmental justice, particularly grassroots climate justice movements that seek to address the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities. This includes advocating for policies and practices that promote environmental justice and address the root causes of climate change.



### Environmentalism



Relative to general environmentalism, environmental justice is seen as having a greater focus on the lives of everyday people and being more grassroots. Environmental justice advocates have argued that mainstream environmentalist movements have sometimes been racist and elitist, as they often prioritize the concerns of more affluent and predominantly white communities. This has led to a disconnect between environmentalism and environmental justice, as the latter seeks to address the unequal distribution of environmental risks and benefits among all members of society.



### Reproductive justice



Many participants in the Reproductive Justice Movement see their struggle as linked with those for environmental justice, and vice versa. Loretta Ross describes the reproductive justice framework as "the complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic well-being of women and girls, based on the full achievement and protection of women's human rights." This includes the right to a healthy and safe environment, as environmental hazards can have negative impacts on reproductive health and rights. Similarly, the environmental justice movement recognizes the importance of reproductive justice and the need to address the intersectionality of environmental and reproductive health issues.





### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the important topic of environmental justice and equity in the context of brownfields policy and practice. We have discussed the historical and current issues surrounding environmental injustice and how it disproportionately affects marginalized communities. We have also examined the role of government policies and regulations in addressing these issues and promoting equity in urban redevelopment.



One key takeaway from this chapter is the need for a holistic approach to brownfields redevelopment that takes into account the social, economic, and environmental impacts on communities. This requires collaboration and communication between all stakeholders, including government agencies, developers, and community members. By incorporating principles of environmental justice and equity into brownfields policy and practice, we can create more sustainable and equitable communities.



As we move forward, it is important to continue advocating for policies and practices that promote environmental justice and equity in brownfields redevelopment. This includes addressing issues such as gentrification and displacement, ensuring community involvement and representation in decision-making processes, and promoting equitable access to resources and opportunities.

### Section: 9.1 Economic Factors in Redevelopment:



Brownfields redevelopment involves significant economic considerations, both in terms of costs and benefits. In this section, we will explore the various economic factors that must be taken into account when considering the redevelopment of brownfield sites.



#### 9.1a Cost-Benefit Analysis



One of the main tools used in evaluating the economic feasibility of brownfields redevelopment is cost-benefit analysis (CBA). This method compares the costs and benefits of a project to determine its overall economic value. CBA is widely used in public policy and decision-making, as it provides a systematic way to evaluate the potential impacts of a project on society.



However, CBA has its limitations and has been subject to criticism. One of the main criticisms is that it does not take into account distributional issues. This means that positive net-benefits are considered decisive, regardless of who benefits and who loses from a project. This can lead to neglecting the multifaceted value factors of a project and potentially exacerbating existing inequalities.



Another criticism is the practice of discounting future costs and benefits. This involves assigning a lower value to future costs and benefits compared to present ones. While this is a common practice in economics, it has been challenged on ethical grounds, as it may undervalue the impacts on future generations.



Despite these criticisms, CBA remains a valuable tool in evaluating the economic feasibility of brownfields redevelopment. It allows for a systematic comparison of the costs and benefits of different redevelopment options, and can help inform decision-making.



In the context of brownfields redevelopment, CBA can be used to assess the costs of environmental assessments, remediation, and infrastructure improvements, as well as the potential benefits such as job creation, increased tax revenue, and revitalization of blighted areas. This information can then be used to determine the economic viability of a project and inform financing decisions.



In the next section, we will explore the various financing options available for brownfields redevelopment.

This information can then be used to determine the most economically viable option for redevelopment.



#### 9.1b Financing Redevelopment



Financing is a crucial aspect of brownfields redevelopment, as it can significantly impact the economic feasibility of a project. There are various financing options available for brownfields redevelopment, including tax increment financing (TIF), grants, loans, and public-private partnerships.



TIF is a popular financing mechanism used in many states, including California and Michigan. It involves using the projected increase in property tax revenue from a redeveloped site to finance the redevelopment itself. This can be a useful tool for municipalities with limited funds, as it allows them to leverage future tax revenue to finance the upfront costs of redevelopment.



However, TIF has also been subject to criticism, particularly in terms of its impact on other local jurisdictions. As mentioned in the related context, TIF can result in lost revenue for schools and other public services, potentially leading to a redistribution of resources. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the distributional impacts of financing options in brownfields redevelopment.



Grants and loans are also commonly used to finance brownfields redevelopment. These can come from various sources, such as federal or state government agencies, non-profit organizations, or private foundations. Grants do not need to be repaid, while loans require repayment with interest. These options can be beneficial for municipalities with limited resources, but they may also come with specific requirements and restrictions.



Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are another financing option for brownfields redevelopment. These involve collaboration between a public entity, such as a municipality, and a private developer. PPPs can provide access to private capital and expertise, but they also come with potential risks, such as cost overruns and conflicts of interest.



In conclusion, financing is a critical consideration in brownfields redevelopment, and the choice of financing mechanism can significantly impact the economic feasibility of a project. It is essential to carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of different financing options and consider their potential distributional impacts.

In the context of brownfields redevelopment, CBA can be used to assess the costs of environmental assessments, remediation, and infrastructure improvements, as well as the potential benefits such as job creation, increased tax revenue, and revitalization of blighted areas. This information can then be used to determine the overall economic viability of a project and inform decisions on whether to move forward with redevelopment plans.



#### 9.1b Economic Impact Analysis



In addition to cost-benefit analysis, economic impact analysis (EIA) is another important tool in evaluating the economic considerations of brownfields redevelopment. EIA focuses on the direct and indirect economic effects of a project on a local or regional economy. This includes job creation, increased tax revenue, and changes in property values.



EIA can be used to assess the potential economic benefits of brownfields redevelopment, such as increased economic activity and job opportunities for local residents. It can also help identify potential negative impacts, such as displacement of low-income residents or increased gentrification.



However, like CBA, EIA also has its limitations. It may not take into account the long-term effects of a project on the local economy, and it may not accurately capture the distributional impacts on different groups within the community.



#### 9.1c Economic Impact of Redevelopment



The economic impact of brownfields redevelopment can be significant, both in terms of direct and indirect effects. Direct effects include the costs of environmental assessments, remediation, and infrastructure improvements, as well as the potential benefits such as job creation and increased tax revenue.



Indirect effects can include changes in property values, increased economic activity in the surrounding area, and potential displacement of low-income residents. These indirect effects can have a significant impact on the local economy and must be carefully considered in the planning and implementation of brownfields redevelopment projects.



In the case of Torrington, Connecticut, the downtown redevelopment plans have the potential to bring in new businesses and increase economic activity in the area. However, there is also the risk of displacing low-income residents and contributing to gentrification. It is important for the city to carefully consider the economic impacts of these plans and ensure that they benefit the community as a whole.



#### 9.1d Public-Private Partnerships



One way to address the economic considerations of brownfields redevelopment is through public-private partnerships (PPPs). These partnerships involve collaboration between government entities and private developers to finance and implement redevelopment projects.



PPPs can help mitigate the financial risks associated with brownfields redevelopment, as the costs and benefits are shared between the public and private sectors. They can also bring in expertise and resources from the private sector to help with the planning and implementation of projects.



However, PPPs also have their challenges, such as potential conflicts of interest and unequal distribution of benefits. It is important for governments to carefully consider the terms and conditions of these partnerships to ensure that they are in the best interest of the community.



In conclusion, economic considerations play a crucial role in brownfields redevelopment. Cost-benefit analysis and economic impact analysis are important tools in evaluating the feasibility and potential impacts of these projects. It is important for governments to carefully consider these economic factors and work towards inclusive and sustainable redevelopment plans that benefit the community as a whole.

## Chapter: - Chapter 10: Liability and Risk Management:



### Section: - Section: 10.1 Understanding Liability:



In the context of brownfields policy and practice, liability refers to the legal responsibility for any potential environmental contamination on a property. This can include both civil and criminal liability, and can extend to current and previous owners, operators, and developers of the property.



Liability for brownfields redevelopment is governed by a complex legal framework that includes federal, state, and local laws and regulations. One of the key federal laws that addresses liability for brownfields is the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act (SBLRBR). This act, passed in 2002, provides liability protections and funding for brownfields redevelopment projects.



Under the SBLRBR, landowners are required to conduct an "all appropriate inquiry" before purchasing a brownfield property. This inquiry involves investigating the previous use of the property and any potential environmental contamination. By conducting this inquiry, landowners can avoid liability for any pre-existing contamination on the property.



In addition to the all appropriate inquiry, the SBLRBR also requires landowners to take steps to protect human health and the environment from any contamination on the property. This can include remediation and cleanup efforts, as well as implementing measures to prevent further contamination.



The SBLRBR also includes provisions for funding brownfields redevelopment projects. This includes $250 million per year for assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training, as well as $50 million per year for state and tribal response programs. These funds are distributed through the Environmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Program, which works with other federal agencies and state agencies to identify and leverage resources for brownfields activities.



In addition to the SBLRBR, there are other federal laws and regulations that address liability for brownfields, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). State and local laws may also have their own liability provisions for brownfields redevelopment.



To manage and mitigate potential risks and liabilities associated with brownfields, stakeholders must work together to develop risk assessment and management strategies. This can include conducting thorough site investigations, implementing remediation and cleanup plans, and obtaining liability insurance.



Stakeholders in brownfields redevelopment projects include government agencies, developers, and community members. Each of these stakeholders may have a different level of liability and risk, and it is important for them to work together to share and manage these responsibilities. This can be achieved through public-private partnerships and community engagement.



In conclusion, understanding liability is crucial for successful brownfields redevelopment. By having a comprehensive understanding of the legal framework and risk management strategies, stakeholders can work together to revitalize abandoned or underutilized properties and contribute to the sustainable and equitable development of urban areas.

## Chapter: - Chapter 10: Liability and Risk Management:



### Section: - Section: 10.2 Risk Management in Redevelopment:



### Subsection (optional): 10.2a Identifying Risks



In order to successfully redevelop a brownfield site, it is important to identify and manage potential risks that may arise during the redevelopment process. These risks can include financial, operational, and non-financial risks.



#### Financial Risk



One of the main financial risks associated with brownfield redevelopment is the potential for unexpected costs. These costs can arise from unforeseen environmental contamination, delays in the redevelopment process, or changes in market conditions. To mitigate this risk, it is important for developers to conduct thorough due diligence and budget for potential contingencies.



#### Operational Risk



Operational risk refers to the potential for disruptions or failures in the day-to-day operations of a brownfield redevelopment project. This can include issues with contractors, equipment, or regulatory compliance. To manage this risk, developers should have contingency plans in place and regularly monitor and assess the progress of the project.



#### Non-Financial Risks



Non-financial risks encompass all other potential risks that may arise during the brownfield redevelopment process. These can include community opposition, political challenges, and reputational risks. To address these risks, developers should engage with stakeholders and communicate openly and transparently about the project.



### Other Risks



In addition to the risks mentioned above, there may be other risks specific to the location or type of brownfield site being redeveloped. These risks should be identified and managed on a case-by-case basis.



To effectively manage risks in brownfield redevelopment, it is important to have a comprehensive risk management plan in place. This plan should include strategies for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks throughout the entire redevelopment process.



## Calculating Metrics from YLTs and WYLTs



Standard risk metrics can be calculated using the Year Loss Table (YLT) and Weighted Year Loss Table (WYLT). These tables provide a comprehensive overview of potential risks and their associated costs.



To calculate metrics from YLTs and WYLTs, developers can use a variety of methods such as the Expected Loss (EL) and the Value at Risk (VaR). These metrics can help developers better understand the potential impact of risks and make informed decisions about risk management strategies.



### International Organization for Standardization



The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides a common framework for understanding and managing risks. According to ISO Guide 73, risk is defined as the "effect of uncertainty on objectives." This definition highlights the importance of considering both positive and negative impacts when assessing risks.



ISO 31000:2018 "Risk management — Guidelines" uses the same definition with a simpler set of notes. This standard also emphasizes the importance of regularly reviewing and updating risk management strategies to adapt to changing circumstances.



### Other Definitions of Risk



While ISO's definition of risk is widely accepted, there are other definitions that have been influential in the field of risk management. Some definitions focus on the negative impacts of risk, while others include both positive and negative impacts. It is important for developers to consider these different perspectives when developing a risk management plan.





### Section: 10.2 Risk Management in Redevelopment:



### Subsection: 10.2b Mitigating Risks



In order to successfully redevelop a brownfield site, it is crucial to have a comprehensive risk management plan in place. This plan should include strategies for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks throughout the entire redevelopment process. In this section, we will discuss some key strategies for mitigating risks in brownfield redevelopment.



#### Risk Reduction



Risk reduction, also known as "optimization," involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss from occurring. This can be achieved through various methods, such as implementing safety measures, conducting thorough due diligence, and having contingency plans in place. For example, sprinklers can be installed to reduce the risk of loss by fire, but this may also cause water damage. In this case, a halon fire suppression system may be a more suitable option, although it may come at a higher cost.



#### Risk Sharing



Another strategy for mitigating risks in brownfield redevelopment is through risk sharing. This involves sharing the risks with other parties who may have a higher capability at managing or reducing risks. For example, a company may outsource certain aspects of the redevelopment process, such as software development or customer support, to another company. This way, the company can focus on business development without having to worry as much about the specific tasks being outsourced.



#### Iterative Development



Modern software development methodologies have also proven to be effective in mitigating risks. By developing and delivering software incrementally, risks can be identified and addressed in earlier stages, reducing the likelihood of costly rework and project delays. This approach also allows for a more flexible and adaptive development process, as changes can be made in each iteration based on feedback and new information.



#### Stakeholder Engagement



Engaging with stakeholders, including the local community and government officials, is crucial in mitigating non-financial risks in brownfield redevelopment. By communicating openly and transparently about the project, developers can address any concerns or opposition and build trust with stakeholders. This can also help to mitigate reputational risks and potential political challenges.



#### Location and Site-Specific Risks



It is important to note that each brownfield site may have its own unique risks that need to be identified and managed. These risks can vary depending on the location, type of contamination, and previous land use. Therefore, it is essential to conduct thorough site assessments and tailor risk management strategies accordingly.



In conclusion, mitigating risks in brownfield redevelopment requires a comprehensive and proactive approach. By implementing strategies such as risk reduction, risk sharing, iterative development, and stakeholder engagement, developers can effectively manage risks and ensure the successful redevelopment of brownfield sites. 





### Section: 10.2 Risk Management in Redevelopment:

In addition to the strategies discussed in the previous section, it is important to also examine real-world case studies in risk management for brownfield redevelopment. By analyzing past projects and their outcomes, we can gain valuable insights and lessons learned for future redevelopment efforts.



#### Case Study 1: Love Canal



One of the most well-known examples of risk management in brownfield redevelopment is the Love Canal project in Niagara Falls, New York. In the 1970s, the area was redeveloped into a residential neighborhood, despite being built on top of a former toxic waste dump. This led to numerous health and environmental issues for the residents, and the site was eventually declared a federal disaster area.



The Love Canal case highlights the importance of thorough due diligence and risk assessment before beginning any redevelopment project. In this case, the risks associated with building on a former waste site were not properly identified and mitigated, leading to disastrous consequences.



#### Case Study 2: The High Line



On a more positive note, the redevelopment of the High Line in New York City serves as a successful example of risk management in brownfield redevelopment. The High Line was an abandoned elevated railway that was transformed into a public park. The project faced numerous challenges, including environmental contamination, structural issues, and community opposition.



Through a collaborative and iterative development process, the project team was able to identify and address these risks, resulting in a successful and beloved public space. This case study highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement and flexibility in the face of unexpected challenges.



#### Case Study 3: The Asarco Smelter



The Asarco Smelter in Tacoma, Washington is another example of successful risk management in brownfield redevelopment. The site was a former copper smelter that had been abandoned for decades, leaving behind significant environmental contamination. The redevelopment project involved extensive remediation efforts and collaboration between multiple stakeholders, including the local community, government agencies, and private developers.



Through careful planning and risk reduction strategies, the site was successfully cleaned up and redeveloped into a mixed-use community, providing economic and environmental benefits to the surrounding area. This case study demonstrates the importance of risk sharing and collaboration in brownfield redevelopment projects.



#### Conclusion



These case studies highlight the importance of a comprehensive risk management plan in brownfield redevelopment. By learning from past successes and failures, we can improve our strategies and approaches for mitigating risks in future projects. It is crucial to involve all stakeholders and to continuously assess and address risks throughout the entire redevelopment process. With proper risk management, we can ensure the successful and sustainable revitalization of urban brownfield sites.
