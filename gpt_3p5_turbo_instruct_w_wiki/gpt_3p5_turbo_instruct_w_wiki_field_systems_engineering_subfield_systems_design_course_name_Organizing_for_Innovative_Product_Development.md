# Organizing for Innovative Product Development: A Comprehensive Guide":





## Foreward



Welcome to "Organizing for Innovative Product Development: A Comprehensive Guide". In this book, we will explore the concept of systematic inventive thinking (SIT) and how it can be applied to new product development. SIT is a method that has been derived from a historical analysis of product-based trends, and it offers a unique approach to understanding and predicting the emergence of new products.



Traditionally, the process of developing new products has involved generating a large number of ideas. However, this can be a complex and un-formalized process, leading some individuals to seek ways to become more productive and efficient in their ideation. This is where SIT comes in - by identifying and applying certain patterns or templates, individuals can streamline their ideation process and potentially gain an advantage over others who treat each task as new and unrelated to past ideation.



In this book, we will delve into the concept of templates and how they can serve as a facilitative tool in the ideation process. We will also explore the usual process of developing new products, which typically begins with a definition of market need and then moves on to developing products to address those needs. This process is often referred to as "form follows function", as the form of the product is determined by its intended function.



Through this comprehensive guide, we hope to provide readers with a deeper understanding of SIT and how it can be applied to innovative product development. We believe that by organizing and streamlining the ideation process, individuals and organizations can achieve greater success in bringing new and innovative products to market.



Thank you for choosing to embark on this journey with us. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their product development process and drive innovation in their respective industries.



Best regards,

#### Subsection: 1.4a Importance of Reward Systems



The mesocorticolimbic circuit, also known as the reward system, plays a crucial role in motivating animals to approach stimuli or engage in behaviors that increase fitness. In the context of organizations, this can be translated to motivating employees to generate new ideas and technologies that can lead to the development of innovative products.



Reward systems serve as a mechanism to increase the adaptive fitness of organizations by promoting associative learning, eliciting approach and consummatory behavior, and triggering positively-valenced emotions. By recognizing and rewarding the contributions of engineers and scientists, organizations can create a culture of innovation and motivate employees to continuously strive for new and improved ideas.



Moreover, reward systems can also help in retaining top talent within organizations. Engineers and scientists who feel valued and recognized for their contributions are more likely to stay with the organization and continue to contribute to its success. This can also attract new talent to the organization, as a reputation for recognizing and rewarding employees can make it an attractive place to work.



However, it is important to note that the design of reward systems must align with the organization's goals and objectives. Intrinsic rewards, such as recognition and opportunities for growth, can be just as effective as extrinsic rewards, such as bonuses and promotions. It is crucial for organizations to understand what motivates their employees and design reward systems accordingly.



In the next section, we will discuss different types of reward systems and how they can be implemented effectively to promote innovation within organizations.

## Chapter 4: Organizational Culture and Innovation:



### Section: 4.1 Understanding Organizational Culture:



Organizational culture plays a crucial role in driving innovation within a company. It is the shared values, beliefs, and behaviors that shape the way employees think and act within an organization. As Robert A. Cooke defines it, culture is the set of behaviors that members believe are required to fit in and meet expectations within their organization. In this section, we will delve deeper into the definition of organizational culture and its impact on innovation.



#### Subsection: 4.1a Definition of Organizational Culture



Organizational culture is often described as the "personality" of a company. It is the unique set of characteristics that make up the company's identity and distinguish it from other organizations. These characteristics are shaped by the company's history, values, beliefs, and practices, and are reflected in the way employees behave and interact with each other.



The Organizational Culture Inventory, developed by Robert A. Cooke, measures twelve behavioral norms that are grouped into three general types of cultures: constructive, passive/defensive, and aggressive/defensive. These cultural norms can either hinder or promote innovation within a company.



#### Subsection: 4.1b Impact of Organizational Culture on Innovation



The type of organizational culture a company has can greatly impact its ability to innovate. In constructive cultures, employees are encouraged to communicate and work as teams, leading to more efficient and effective problem-solving. This type of culture values quality over quantity, creativity over conformity, and cooperation over competition, all of which are essential for fostering innovation.



On the other hand, passive/defensive cultures can hinder innovation by pressuring employees to conform and avoid conflict. In these cultures, rules and procedures are more important than personal beliefs and ideas, stifling creativity and risk-taking. Similarly, aggressive/defensive cultures, where competition and individual success are valued over collaboration, can also hinder innovation by creating a cut-throat environment that discourages sharing of ideas and taking risks.



#### Subsection: 4.1c Key Elements of an Innovative Culture



To foster a culture of innovation, companies must focus on creating an environment that encourages and supports creativity, risk-taking, and collaboration. This can be achieved through the following key elements:



- Open communication and transparency: Employees should feel comfortable sharing their ideas and opinions without fear of judgment or retribution. This requires open communication channels and a transparent decision-making process.



- Autonomy and empowerment: Giving employees the autonomy to make decisions and take risks can lead to more innovative ideas and solutions. Empowering employees to take ownership of their work and providing them with the necessary resources and support can also foster a culture of innovation.



- Diversity and inclusion: A diverse workforce brings a variety of perspectives and experiences, which can lead to more innovative ideas. Companies must create an inclusive culture where all employees feel valued and respected, regardless of their background or identity.



- Continuous learning and improvement: Innovation requires a willingness to learn and adapt. Companies must promote a culture of continuous learning and improvement, where employees are encouraged to experiment and learn from their failures.



#### Subsection: 4.1d Role of Leadership in Shaping Organizational Culture for Innovation



Leaders play a crucial role in shaping and cultivating an organizational culture that promotes innovation. They must lead by example and embody the key elements of an innovative culture. Effective leaders are able to inspire and motivate their teams to think outside the box and take risks. They also prioritize diversity and inclusion, and create a safe and supportive environment for their employees to share their ideas.



#### Subsection: 4.1e Real-World Examples of Companies with Strong Innovative Cultures



Many successful companies have a strong culture of innovation that has contributed to their success. For example, Google is known for its innovative culture, where employees are encouraged to spend 20% of their time on personal projects and ideas. This has led to the development of products such as Gmail and Google Maps. Similarly, 3M's culture of innovation has resulted in over 100,000 patents and products such as Post-it Notes and Scotchgard.



#### Subsection: 4.1f Challenges in Changing Organizational Culture for Innovation



Changing an organization's culture to become more innovative can be a challenging and complex process. It requires buy-in from all levels of the organization and a willingness to challenge the status quo. Some common challenges include resistance to change, lack of resources, and conflicting values and beliefs. However, with proper leadership and a clear strategy, these challenges can be overcome.



In conclusion, organizational culture plays a crucial role in driving innovation within a company. By understanding the definition and impact of organizational culture on innovation, and focusing on key elements such as open communication, diversity and inclusion, and continuous learning, companies can create a culture that fosters innovation and sets them apart from their competitors.

This can be achieved through providing opportunities for learning and development, recognizing and rewarding innovative ideas, and promoting a culture of continuous improvement.



#### 4. Foster a culture of experimentation



Innovation often involves taking risks and trying new things. Companies should create a culture where employees are encouraged to experiment and think outside the box. This can be achieved through providing resources and support for new ideas, allowing for failure and learning from mistakes, and promoting a culture of curiosity and exploration.



#### 5. Lead by example



Leaders play a crucial role in shaping the culture of an organization. They should lead by example and embody the values and behaviors that promote innovation. This can be achieved through actively seeking and implementing new ideas, promoting a culture of transparency and open communication, and encouraging a growth mindset among employees.

Innovation leadership is a philosophy and technique that combines different leadership styles to influence employees to produce creative ideas, products, and services. The key role in the practice of innovation leadership is the innovation leader. Dr. David Gliddon (2006) developed the competency model of innovation leaders and established the concept of innovation leadership at Penn State University.



As an approach to organization development, innovation leadership can support achievement of the mission or the vision of an organization or group. With new technologies and processes, it is necessary for organizations to think innovatively to ensure continued success and stay competitive. To adapt to new changes, "The need for innovation in organizations has resulted in a new focus on the role of leaders in shaping the nature and success of creative efforts." Without innovation leadership, organizations are likely to struggle. This new call for innovation represents the shift from the 20th century, traditional view of organizational practices, which discouraged employee innovative behaviors, to the 21st-century view of valuing innovative thinking as a "potentially powerful influence on organizational performance."

The second level, Supervisory Encouragement, highlights the roles of supervisors and project managers in providing goal clarity, promoting open interaction between supervisors and subordinates, and supporting a team's work and ideas. This level of encouragement emphasizes the concepts of transformational leadership, where leaders inspire and motivate their team to achieve their full potential and drive innovation.



### Leadership Styles and Innovation



Leadership styles play a crucial role in shaping an organization's culture and driving innovation. Different leadership styles can have varying effects on an organization's ability to innovate. For example, transformational leadership, which focuses on inspiring and motivating employees, has been found to have a positive impact on organizational innovation. On the other hand, transactional leadership, which relies on rewards and punishments, may hinder creativity and innovation.



Innovative leaders must possess a combination of different leadership styles to effectively lead the innovation process. They must be able to inspire and motivate their team while also providing clear goals and expectations.

## Basic Team Dynamics



Teamwork is an essential aspect of innovative product development. It involves individuals working together towards a common goal, utilizing their diverse skills and perspectives to generate creative solutions. However, effective teamwork does not happen automatically; it requires a strong understanding of team dynamics and processes.



Basic team dynamics include communication, collaboration, and coordination. These conditions are necessary for a team to produce a high-quality output. To measure the effectiveness of teamwork, an organization must examine the quality of the output, the process, and the members' experience. A successful team will meet or exceed the organization's standards, have a well-defined process that helps them reach their goals, and have high levels of satisfaction among team members.



## Processes



Specific teamwork processes have been identified to fall into three categories: transition processes, action processes, and interpersonal processes.



### Transition Processes



Transition processes occur between periods of action. During this time, team members can evaluate their overall performance as a team and as individuals, provide feedback to each other, clarify upcoming tasks, and make any necessary changes to improve collaboration. These processes are crucial for reflection and improvement within the team.



### Action Processes



Action processes take place when the team is actively working towards achieving its goals and objectives. In this stage, team members keep each other informed about their progress and responsibilities, while also providing support and assistance to one another. Feedback and collaboration continue to be essential components of this process.



### Interpersonal Processes



Interpersonal processes occur between team members and are present in both action and transition periods. This continuous process involves open communication and support among team members. It is crucial for building trust and fostering a positive team dynamic.



Teamwork performance generally improves when a team passes through these processes. They enhance coordination and communication between team members, leading to increased productivity and innovation.



## Understanding Team Dynamics



To effectively manage team dynamics, it is essential to understand the different roles and personalities within a team. Each team member brings unique skills, perspectives, and experiences to the table, and it is crucial to recognize and utilize these differences to drive innovation.



Team dynamics can also be influenced by external factors, such as organizational culture and leadership. A strong organizational culture that values collaboration and innovation can greatly enhance team dynamics and lead to more successful outcomes.



In addition, leadership plays a critical role in shaping team dynamics. A leader with strong innovation leadership skills can inspire and motivate team members to think creatively and generate new ideas.

## Conclusion



Teamwork and team dynamics are essential components of innovative product development. By understanding and effectively managing team dynamics, organizations can create a collaborative and innovative environment that drives success. Strong leadership and a supportive organizational culture are crucial for promoting effective teamwork and driving innovation. 





# Virtual Teams and Innovation



In today's globalized world, virtual teams have become an increasingly popular way for organizations to manage their operations and promote innovation. Virtual teams are groups of individuals who work together towards a common goal, but are not located in the same physical space. This allows companies to recruit from a larger pool of employees and tap into a diverse range of skills and perspectives, leading to increased creativity and participation.



## Impact of Virtual Teams on Innovation



Research has shown that when managed effectively, virtual teams can be highly effective in promoting innovation. In a study by Gibson and Gibbs (2006), it was found that teams were more innovative as virtuality increased when they had a psychologically safe communication climate. This means that when team members feel comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions without fear of judgement, they are more likely to contribute to the team's innovation process.



Furthermore, virtual teams allow for a greater geographic reach for organizations. Multinational companies often use virtual teams to coordinate operations across different locations and cultural boundaries. This not only enhances knowledge sharing and integration, but also allows for the identification and transfer of best practices across locations, resulting in improved operational efficiency.



## Cultural Diversity and Innovation



One of the key factors that contribute to the success of virtual teams in promoting innovation is cultural diversity. Chidambaram and Bostrom (1993) found that virtual teams generate more ideas compared to traditional teams, and part of this effect can be attributed to cultural diversity. When individuals from different cultural backgrounds come together, they bring with them a diverse range of experiences and perspectives. This encourages creativity and leads to conflicting viewpoints, which in turn, increases the likelihood of exploring and considering multiple options.



## Team Dynamics and Innovation



While virtual teams have the potential to promote innovation, it is important to understand the impact of team dynamics on the innovation process. Teamwork is an essential aspect of innovative product development, and it involves individuals working together towards a common goal, utilizing their diverse skills and perspectives to generate creative solutions.

# Virtual team



### Innovation



When managed effectively, virtual teams can be highly effective in promoting innovation, creativity, and participation. For example, in Gibson and Gibbs’ (2006) study of design team innovation, teams were more innovative as virtuality increased when they had a psychologically safe communication climate. Because a company is able to recruit from a larger pool of employees when using virtual teams, a growing amount of talent and distributed expertise is obtainable without the employee traveling often. The use of virtual teams also allows employees to participate in multiple projects within the company that are located on different sites. This in turn helps the company by allowing them to reuse existing resources so that they are not required to hire a new employee to do the same job.



Chidambaram and Bostrom (1993) found that virtual teams generate more ideas compared to traditional teams. Part of this effect can be attributed to cultural diversity, which has been shown to positively impact group decision-making. Combined with collaborative conflict management, groups of individuals from different cultural perspectives are more likely to actively participate in group decision making. The differing backgrounds and experiences of these group members also encourage creativity and create conflicting viewpoints, which make it more likely that multiple options are explored and considered.

## Core competencies and product development



Core competencies are essential for a company's success in product development. According to Prahalad and Hamel (1990), core competencies are the engines that drive the development of core products and services. These competencies are the foundation on which a company grows, much like a tree whose fruit are the end products.



Core products are crucial for a company's competitiveness in the market. They are the physical embodiment of core competencies and contribute to the success of a wide range of end products. In recent years, approaches have been developed to identify and map core competencies to specific products in a company's portfolio. One such approach, proposed by Danilovic & Leisner (2007), uses design structure matrices to identify clusters of competencies that can be aggregated to core competencies. Similarly, Bonjour & Micaelli (2010) have introduced a method for assessing a company's development of core competencies. More recently, Hein et al. have linked core competencies to Christensen's concept of capabilities, which includes resources, processes, and priorities. They have also presented a method for evaluating different product architectures in terms of their contribution to the development of core competencies.



## First-mover advantage



First-mover advantage is a concept that has been widely studied in the field of marketing. It refers to the benefits that a company gains by being the first to introduce a new product or service to the market. However, there are several problems that arise when attempting to define and measure first-mover advantages. Many studies have been done to identify all possible "pioneering advantages," but the results have only provided a basic framework without any clear conclusions.



## Issues for future research



There are still many unanswered questions and challenges when it comes to understanding first-mover advantages. Some of the key issues for future research include:



- Identifying and measuring the specific benefits of being a first-mover in different industries and markets.

- Understanding the role of timing and market conditions in determining the success of first-mover strategies.

- Examining the potential drawbacks and risks of being a first-mover, such as high costs and the need for continuous innovation.

- Investigating the impact of technological advancements and disruptive innovations on first-mover advantages.

- Exploring the relationship between first-mover advantages and other factors such as brand reputation and customer loyalty.



As the business landscape continues to evolve, it is important for researchers to continue studying and analyzing the concept of first-mover advantage to provide valuable insights for companies looking to gain a competitive edge in the market.

### Section: 16.4 Branding and Innovation:



Innovation and marketing are two crucial components of product development. While innovation drives the creation of new and improved products, marketing ensures that these products reach the right target audience and are perceived in a positive light. In this section, we will explore the relationship between branding and innovation, and how they work together to create successful products.



#### 16.4a Understanding Branding



Branding is a key aspect of marketing that involves creating a unique identity for a product or company. It encompasses all the elements that make a product or company stand out from its competitors, such as its name, logo, design, and messaging. Branding is essential for product development as it helps to differentiate a product from others in the market and creates a lasting impression on consumers.



One of the main goals of branding is to create brand associations in the minds of consumers. These associations are a network of information nodes that are linked to a key variable, such as brand image, brand personality, brand attitude, and brand preference. For example, a consumer may associate a brand with a certain image or personality, which can influence their purchasing decisions.



Brand attitude is another important aspect of branding. It refers to the overall evaluation of a brand by consumers based on its perceived ability to meet their needs and desires. A positive brand attitude can lead to increased brand loyalty and repeat purchases.



Brand trust is also a crucial factor in branding. It refers to the consumer's expectation that a brand will do what is right. In fact, studies have shown that brand trust is a deciding factor for many consumers when making a purchase.



Brand awareness is another key element of branding. It refers to the extent to which consumers can identify a brand under various conditions. There are two types of brand awareness: brand recognition and brand recall. Brand recognition is the ability to associate a brand with its visual elements, such as logo or color scheme, without seeing the brand name. Brand recall, on the other hand, is the ability to remember a brand when prompted with a product category or need.



Brand equity is a term that is often used in the literature, and it has two distinct definitions. The first definition is an accounting one, which measures the financial value of a brand. The second definition, which is more relevant to marketing, refers to the strength of consumers' attachment to a brand and the associations and beliefs they have about it.



Brand image is another important aspect of branding. It refers to the image that an organization wants to project and the psychological meaning associated with a brand. A strong brand image can help to create a positive perception of a product or company in the minds of consumers.



In conclusion, branding plays a crucial role in product development by creating a unique identity for a product or company and influencing consumer perceptions and behaviors. Understanding branding is essential for companies looking to innovate and create successful products.
