### L*-orderings under uncertainty



Lexicographic preferences have also been found useful in describing choices under uncertainty. Let "w<sub>i</sub>" = "w<sub>i</sub>"("x", "p"("x")) be the "i"th utility from a vector of prospects "x" = ("x"<sub>1</sub>,…, "x<sub>k</sub>",…) which has associated probabilities "p"("x") = ("p"<sub>1</sub>("x<sub>1</sub>"),…,"p<sub>k</sub>"("x<sub>n</sub>")). Note that the criterion function "w<sub>i</sub>" depends explicitly not only on "x" but also on the probabilities associated with "x". One may then define "w<sub>¡</sub>"* as the satisficing level of "w<sub>¡</sub>" and proceed to define lexicographic preference in the customary manner, with "v"("x") = ["v"<sub>1</sub>("x"),"v"<sub>2</sub>(x),…] and "v"<sub>i</sub>("x") = min ("w<sub>i</sub>" ("x", "p"(x), "w<sub>i</sub>"*) for all "i". It is straightforward to reproduce expected utility as a particular case by defining some primitive utility function "u"(.) that depends only on the individual "x<sub>k</sub>". In this case, one may write "w"<sub>1</sub>("x", "p"("x")•"u"("x")), where "u"("x") = ["u"("x"<sub>1</sub>), "u"("x"<sub>2</sub>),…] and set "w"<sub>1</sub>* sufficiently high to obtain the usual subjective expected utility. If other criteria are allowed to come into play, on the other hand, different possibilities arise. For example, for some "i", "w<sub>i</sub>" may depend only on the probability of ruinous levels of "x", or on the maximal values of "x".



Encarnación [1987] uses preferences of this form in an ambitious attempt to reconstruct and explain all the apparent “paradoxes” in choice theory. Apart from lexicographic comparisons the new element introduced into the structure was the notion of significant differences in the values of criterion functions. Choice between two uncertain alternatives x and y, he suggests, turns on whether they differ significantly on the following lexicographically arranged criteria: (1) expected value, (2) the possibility of catastrophic failure, and (3) the maximum potential value. This approach, known as Applied Utility Theory, is a valuable tool in Tradespace Exploration for space systems.

### Section: 2.1 Applied Utility Theory



Applied Utility Theory (AUT) is a decision-making framework that is commonly used in Tradespace Exploration for space systems. It is based on the concept of lexicographic preferences, where criteria are ranked in a hierarchical order and decisions are made based on the highest-ranked criterion that satisfies a certain threshold.



In the context of space systems, AUT is used to evaluate and compare different design options based on their expected value, potential for catastrophic failure, and maximum potential value. This approach allows for a systematic and comprehensive analysis of trade-offs, ensuring that the chosen design meets the necessary requirements and objectives.



#### Subsection: 2.1a Basics of Applied Utility Theory



The basic principle of AUT is to assign a utility value to each design option based on its performance in the three criteria mentioned above. This utility value is then used to rank the options and determine the most optimal design.



To calculate the utility value, a primitive utility function is first defined for each criterion. This function assigns a numerical value to the performance of the design in that specific criterion. For example, the expected value criterion may use a function that assigns a higher value to designs with a higher expected value.



Once the primitive utility functions are defined, the overall utility value for each design is calculated by multiplying the primitive utility values for each criterion. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the design, taking into account all three criteria.



In order to make a decision, a threshold value is set for each criterion. This threshold represents the minimum acceptable value for that criterion. The design with the highest overall utility value that meets all three threshold values is then chosen as the optimal design.



AUT allows for a systematic and structured approach to Tradespace Exploration, ensuring that all important criteria are considered and trade-offs are carefully evaluated. However, it is important to note that this approach is not without its limitations and challenges, which we will discuss in the following sections.

## Chapter 2: MATE: Tradespace Exploration:



### Section: 2.1 Applied Utility Theory:



### Subsection (optional): 2.1b Utility Theory in Tradespace Exploration



Utility theory is a fundamental concept in decision-making under uncertainty. It provides a framework for evaluating and comparing different options based on their expected outcomes and the decision maker's preferences. In this section, we will explore how utility theory can be applied in the context of tradespace exploration, specifically in the MATE (Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration) methodology.



MATE is a decision-making framework that helps engineers and designers evaluate and compare different design options for complex systems, such as space systems. It takes into account multiple attributes, such as cost, performance, and risk, and allows decision makers to explore the tradeoffs between these attributes. In order to make informed decisions, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of utility theory and how it can be used in the MATE methodology.



#### Utility Theory in Tradespace Exploration



In tradespace exploration, the goal is to find the optimal design option that maximizes the overall utility of the system. This utility is a function of the system's attributes, which can be represented as a vector of prospects, denoted as "x" = ("x"<sub>1</sub>,…, "x<sub>k</sub>",…). Each attribute has associated probabilities, denoted as "p"("x") = ("p"<sub>1</sub>("x<sub>1</sub>"),…,"p<sub>k</sub>"("x<sub>n</sub>")). The decision maker's preferences are then represented by a criterion function, denoted as "w<sub>i</sub>" = "w<sub>i</sub>"("x", "p"("x")), which maps the vector of prospects and probabilities to a numerical value representing the utility of the system.



One approach to decision-making under uncertainty is to use lexicographic preferences, where the decision maker prioritizes the attributes in a specific order. In this case, the criterion function "w<sub>i</sub>" depends explicitly not only on the vector of prospects "x", but also on the associated probabilities "p"("x"). The decision maker then sets a satisficing level, denoted as "w<sub>i</sub>"*, for each attribute, and compares the values of the criterion function for each attribute. The final decision is made based on the lexicographic order of the attributes, with the most important attribute being the first in the order.



Another approach is to use expected utility theory, where the decision maker assigns a utility value to each possible outcome and calculates the expected utility for each design option. This approach requires the decision maker to have a clear understanding of their preferences and to be able to assign numerical values to each attribute.



In the MATE methodology, both lexicographic preferences and expected utility theory can be used to evaluate and compare design options. The decision maker can set their preferences and satisficing levels for each attribute, and then use the MATE tool to explore the tradeoffs between the attributes and make an informed decision.



In conclusion, utility theory is a powerful tool in tradespace exploration, allowing decision makers to evaluate and compare complex design options. By understanding the different approaches and their applications, engineers and designers can make more informed decisions and optimize the performance of their systems.

One of the key aspects of MATE is the ability to evaluate and compare different design options based on their attributes. This is where utility theory comes into play. Let's consider a hypothetical example of designing a satellite for a space mission. The satellite has three main attributes: cost, performance, and reliability. The decision maker must choose between two design options: Option A and Option B.



Option A has a lower cost, but lower performance and reliability compared to Option B. On the other hand, Option B has a higher cost, but higher performance and reliability. How can the decision maker determine which option is the better choice?



This is where utility theory comes in. The decision maker must first define their preferences for each attribute. Let's say the decision maker values performance twice as much as cost and reliability. This can be represented by the criterion function "w<sub>i</sub>" = 2"p"<sub>1</sub>("x<sub>1</sub>") + "p"<sub>2</sub>("x<sub>2</sub>") + "p"<sub>3</sub>("x<sub>3</sub>"), where "p"<sub>1</sub>("x<sub>1</sub>") represents the probability of achieving a certain level of performance, "p"<sub>2</sub>("x<sub>2</sub>") represents the probability of staying within the budget, and "p"<sub>3</sub>("x<sub>3</sub>") represents the probability of the satellite functioning reliably.



Using this criterion function, the decision maker can calculate the overall utility of each option. Option A has a utility of 2(0.8) + 0.6 + 0.9 = 2.9, while Option B has a utility of 2(0.9) + 0.4 + 0.8 = 3.8. Based on these calculations, Option B has a higher utility and would be the better choice.



In this example, we can see how utility theory can be used to make informed decisions in tradespace exploration. By assigning values to each attribute and using a criterion function, the decision maker can evaluate and compare different design options to find the optimal solution.



#### Conclusion



In conclusion, utility theory is a powerful tool in tradespace exploration and can greatly assist decision makers in making informed choices. By understanding the fundamentals of utility theory and its application in the MATE methodology, engineers and designers can effectively evaluate and compare different design options to find the best solution for complex systems.

### Section: 2.2 Modeling and Exploring the Tradespace:



### Subsection (optional): 2.2a Introduction to Tradespace Modeling



In the previous section, we discussed the importance of utility theory in tradespace exploration. In this section, we will delve deeper into the process of modeling and exploring the tradespace using the MATE methodology.



#### Introduction to Tradespace Modeling



Tradespace modeling is the process of creating a mathematical representation of the design space for a given system. This representation allows for the exploration and evaluation of different design options based on their attributes. In the context of space systems, tradespace modeling is crucial for making informed decisions about the design and development of complex systems.



The first step in tradespace modeling is defining the design space. This includes identifying all the possible design options and their corresponding attributes. In the example of designing a satellite, the design space would include different configurations of the satellite, such as size, shape, materials, and components.



Once the design space is defined, the next step is to assign values to each attribute for each design option. This is where utility theory comes into play. The decision maker must determine their preferences for each attribute and assign weights to them. This allows for the calculation of the overall utility of each design option.



After the values for each attribute are assigned, the tradespace can be visualized using graphs or charts. This allows for a better understanding of the relationships between different design options and their attributes. It also helps in identifying tradeoffs between different attributes and their impact on the overall utility of a design option.



Tradespace modeling is an iterative process, meaning that it can be refined and updated as more information becomes available. This allows for a more comprehensive exploration of the design space and the identification of optimal design options.



In the next section, we will discuss the different methods and tools used for tradespace exploration and how they can be applied in the MATE methodology.

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of tradespace modeling in the MATE methodology. In this section, we will explore some techniques for tradespace exploration that can aid in the decision-making process for designing space systems.



#### Sensitivity Analysis



Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to understand the impact of changes in design parameters on the overall utility of a system. It involves varying one or more design parameters while keeping the others constant and observing the resulting changes in the system's utility. This allows for the identification of critical design parameters and their impact on the overall performance of the system.



For example, in the design of a satellite, sensitivity analysis can be used to understand the effect of changing the material used for the satellite's structure. By varying the material while keeping other parameters constant, the designer can observe the changes in the satellite's weight, cost, and other attributes, and determine the optimal material for the given design space.



#### Pareto Analysis



Pareto analysis is a technique used to identify the most critical design parameters that have the most significant impact on the overall utility of a system. It involves plotting the utility of different design options against their corresponding attributes and identifying the Pareto-optimal solutions, which are the design options that provide the highest utility for a given set of attributes.



In the context of space systems, Pareto analysis can be used to identify the most critical design parameters that need to be optimized for a given set of design options. This can help in narrowing down the design space and focusing on the most promising solutions.



#### Monte Carlo Simulation



Monte Carlo simulation is a technique used to model the uncertainty and variability in a system. It involves running multiple simulations with different input values for the system's parameters and observing the resulting output. This allows for the identification of the range of possible outcomes and their probabilities.



In the design of space systems, Monte Carlo simulation can be used to understand the impact of uncertainties, such as launch vehicle performance, on the overall utility of a system. By running multiple simulations with different values for these uncertain parameters, designers can gain a better understanding of the potential risks and make informed decisions about the design of their system.



#### Multi-Objective Optimization



Multi-objective optimization is a technique used to find the optimal solution for a system with multiple conflicting objectives. In the context of space systems, this can be used to find the best compromise between different design parameters, such as cost, weight, and performance.



By using multi-objective optimization, designers can explore the tradeoffs between different design options and identify the most promising solutions that provide the best balance between conflicting objectives.



In conclusion, these techniques for tradespace exploration can aid in the decision-making process for designing space systems. By using a combination of these techniques, designers can gain a better understanding of the design space and make informed decisions about the optimal design for their system.

##### Case Study 3: Mars Climate Orbiter



The Mars Climate Orbiter was a space probe launched by NASA in 1998 to study the Martian climate and atmosphere. It was designed to be 3-axis stabilized and included dual redundancy on its most important systems. The spacecraft was powered by a 3-panel solar array and had a high-gain antenna for communication.



Unfortunately, the mission was deemed a failure when the spacecraft entered the Martian atmosphere at the wrong angle and disintegrated. This was due to a miscommunication between the spacecraft's navigation software, which used English units, and the ground control team, which used metric units. This case study highlights the importance of thorough testing and communication in space system architectures.



By examining these case studies, we can see the different types and classes of space system architectures in action and understand their strengths and weaknesses. This knowledge can be applied to future space missions to improve their design and increase their chances of success.
