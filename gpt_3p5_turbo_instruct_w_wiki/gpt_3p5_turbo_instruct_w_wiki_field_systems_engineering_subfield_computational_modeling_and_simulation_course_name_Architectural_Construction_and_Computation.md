We will explore this concept further and discuss how it can be applied in the development and deployment of CAAD systems.



As we delve into the world of open-source architecture and CAAD, we will also touch upon the concept of the "Internet of things" and its impact on the field of architecture. With the increasing use of embedded sensing and computing, materials are now able to communicate their position and state during fabrication and construction, aiding in the overall design process.



This book is not just a theoretical exploration of these concepts, but also a practical guide for architects and designers. We will discuss various tools and practices that can be used to implement open-source architecture and CAAD, as well as the potential for creating a rich ecosystem of "apps" for these systems.



I hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, professionals, and anyone interested in the ever-evolving field of architecture. Let us embark on this journey together and discover the endless possibilities that arise when architecture and technology intersect. 





## Chapter: Architectural Construction and Computation: Principles, Processes, and Applications



### Introduction:



In the field of architecture, the design process has traditionally been a manual and iterative one. Architects would start with a concept, sketch it out on paper, and then refine it through multiple iterations until a final design was reached. This process was time-consuming and often limited by the architect's own creativity and experience. However, with the advancement of technology, the use of computational tools in architectural design has become increasingly prevalent.



This chapter will provide an introduction to traditional design methods in architecture and how they have evolved with the integration of computational tools. We will explore the principles and processes of traditional design, including the use of hand-drawn sketches, physical models, and manual calculations. We will also discuss the limitations of traditional design and how computational tools have helped to overcome these limitations.



Furthermore, this chapter will also touch upon the various applications of computational tools in architectural design. From parametric design to generative design, we will explore how these tools have revolutionized the way architects approach the design process. We will also discuss the benefits and challenges of using computational tools in architecture, and how they have impacted the field as a whole.



Overall, this chapter aims to provide a foundation for understanding the role of computational tools in architectural design. By exploring traditional design methods and their evolution, we can gain a better understanding of the principles and processes that have shaped the field of architecture. This will set the stage for the rest of the book, where we will delve deeper into the various applications and techniques of computational design in architecture.





# Architectural Construction and Computation: Principles, Processes, and Applications



## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design



### Section 1.1: Traditional Design Principles



#### Subsection 1.1a: History of Traditional Design



The history of traditional design in architecture can be traced back to the 1700s in Western fashion. During this time, there was a strong emphasis on classicism and the use of traditional design elements in both fashion and architecture. This trend continued into the 1730s, with architects and industrial designers drawing inspiration from existing buildings and products to create new and innovative designs.



The traditional design approach is rooted in the belief that traditional designs are timeless and functional, making them the preferred typology for buildings and products. This approach also values the preservation and restoration of existing buildings and products, as well as the use of vernacular design elements.



The design value of restoration and preservation is based on the commitment to preserve the best of buildings and products for future generations. This often involves restoring a building or product to its original design, and is rooted in three perspectives: historical, cultural, and aesthetic. By preserving these elements, we can gain a better understanding of our past and appreciate the cultural significance of traditional designs.



The vernacular design value is based on the use of local materials and techniques to create functional and sustainable designs. This approach values the integration of traditional design elements into modern architecture, creating a sense of continuity and connection to the past.



Overall, the history of traditional design in architecture is a rich and diverse one, with a strong emphasis on preserving and reusing existing design elements. This approach has influenced the principles and processes of traditional design, and continues to shape the field of architecture today. In the following sections, we will explore these principles and processes in more detail, as well as the role of computational tools in traditional design.





# Architectural Construction and Computation: Principles, Processes, and Applications



## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design



### Section 1.1: Traditional Design Principles



#### Subsection 1.1b: Principles and Elements



Traditional design principles are the fundamental concepts that guide the creation of traditional designs in architecture. These principles are rooted in the belief that traditional designs are timeless and functional, making them the preferred typology for buildings and products. They also value the preservation and restoration of existing buildings and products, as well as the use of vernacular design elements.



One of the key principles of traditional design is symmetry. This principle is based on the idea that a design should be balanced and harmonious, with equal weight and proportion on both sides. This can be seen in the use of symmetrical facades in traditional buildings, where the left and right sides mirror each other.



Another important principle is hierarchy. This refers to the organization of elements within a design, with some elements being more dominant and others being subordinate. In traditional design, this can be seen in the use of a central focal point, such as a grand entrance or a prominent feature, to create a sense of hierarchy and importance.



Proportion is also a key principle in traditional design. This refers to the relationship between different elements in a design, and how they relate to each other in terms of size and scale. Traditional designs often use the golden ratio, a mathematical ratio that is believed to create the most aesthetically pleasing proportions.



The use of traditional design elements is also a fundamental principle. These elements, such as columns, arches, and pediments, are derived from classical architecture and are used to create a sense of timelessness and grandeur in traditional designs.



In addition to these principles, traditional design also values the use of local materials and techniques, as well as the integration of traditional design elements into modern architecture. This not only creates a sense of continuity and connection to the past, but also promotes sustainability and cultural preservation.



Overall, these principles guide the creation of traditional designs and are essential to understanding the history and significance of traditional design in architecture. In the next section, we will explore the history of traditional design in more detail and how it has influenced the principles and processes of traditional design.





# Architectural Construction and Computation: Principles, Processes, and Applications



## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design



### Section 1.1: Traditional Design Principles



#### Subsection 1.1c: Traditional vs. Modern Design



In the world of architecture and industrial design, there has always been a debate between traditional and modern approaches. While some argue that modern design is the way of the future, others believe that traditional design principles hold timeless value and should continue to be used in the creation of buildings and products.



One of the main differences between traditional and modern design is the approach to inspiration. Traditional design values the use of existing design elements and styles, often drawing from classical architecture and local vernacular. This approach values the preservation and restoration of existing buildings and products, as well as the use of traditional design elements to create a sense of timelessness and grandeur.



On the other hand, modern design often focuses on creating new and innovative solutions, using technology and contemporary materials to push the boundaries of design. This approach values functionality and efficiency, often resulting in minimalist and sleek designs.



Another key difference between traditional and modern design is the use of symmetry. Traditional design principles value symmetry as a way to create balance and harmony, while modern design often embraces asymmetry and irregularity as a way to create visual interest.



In terms of hierarchy, traditional design often uses a central focal point to create a sense of importance and dominance, while modern design may distribute elements more evenly to create a sense of equality.



Proportion is also approached differently in traditional and modern design. Traditional design often follows the golden ratio, while modern design may use more abstract and unconventional proportions.



Ultimately, the choice between traditional and modern design comes down to personal preference and the specific needs of a project. Both approaches have their own unique strengths and can result in stunning and functional designs. In this book, we will explore the principles, processes, and applications of traditional design, and how they can be combined with computational tools to create innovative and sustainable solutions.





# Architectural Construction and Computation: Principles, Processes, and Applications



## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design



### Section 1.2: Design Process



#### Subsection 1.2a: Conceptualization



In the design process, conceptualization is a crucial step that involves the formation of a higher level abstraction to facilitate the discussion and comparison of various ontologies. This allows for knowledge sharing and reuse, as each ontology based on the same overarching conceptualization can be mapped into specific elements and their relationships.



However, the issue of how to describe the conceptualization in terms that can encompass multiple ontologies has been a longstanding problem, often referred to as the "Tower of Babel" problem. This problem arises when individuals using different ontologies try to communicate with each other. While there is no general resolution to this problem, there are different approaches that can be taken, such as a "bottom-up" or "top-down" approach.



In more artificial situations, such as information systems, the idea of a conceptualization and its ontological commitment to various ontologies is possible. This involves the steps of forming a conceptualization and its ontologies, which can be compared to the process of expressing a process in pseudocode and implementing it in different formal computer languages. The pseudocode serves as a higher level abstraction, making it easier to understand the instructions and compare implementations, while the formal languages allow for the compilation of the ideas as computer instructions.



Similarly, in mathematics, a very general formulation can be illustrated with more specialized examples, serving as "applications" of the conceptualization. For instance, aspects of a function space can be demonstrated using a vector space or a topological space, introducing interpretations of the "elements" of the conceptualization and additional relationships.



In the context of architectural design, conceptualization plays a crucial role in the creation of buildings and products. It allows for the comparison and integration of different design elements and styles, drawing from traditional and modern approaches. While traditional design values the use of existing design elements and styles, modern design often focuses on creating new and innovative solutions. However, both approaches can benefit from the use of a conceptualization, as it allows for the preservation of traditional design principles while also pushing the boundaries of modern design.





# Architectural Construction and Computation: Principles, Processes, and Applications



## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design



### Section 1.2: Design Process



#### Subsection 1.2b: Design Development



After the conceptualization stage, the design process moves on to the development stage. This is where the initial ideas and concepts are refined and transformed into more concrete designs. The design development stage is crucial in ensuring that the final design meets all the necessary requirements and is feasible to construct.



One approach to design development is the "bottom-up" approach, where the design is developed by starting with the individual elements and gradually building up to the overall design. This approach allows for a more detailed and thorough understanding of each element and how they fit together to form the final design.



Another approach is the "top-down" approach, where the design is developed by starting with the overall concept and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable elements. This approach allows for a more holistic view of the design and ensures that all elements are aligned with the overall concept.



In architectural design, the design development stage involves creating detailed drawings and models of the proposed design. This allows for a better visualization of the final product and helps identify any potential issues or challenges that may arise during construction.



The design development stage also involves considering various factors such as structural integrity, building codes and regulations, and cost-effectiveness. This ensures that the final design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and practical.



In addition to traditional design methods, the use of computational tools and techniques has become increasingly prevalent in the design development stage. These tools allow for more efficient and accurate design iterations, as well as the exploration of complex design possibilities that may not have been possible with traditional methods.



Overall, the design development stage is a crucial step in the design process, as it bridges the gap between conceptualization and construction. It allows for the refinement and optimization of the initial ideas, resulting in a well-developed and feasible design that meets all the necessary requirements. 





# Architectural Construction and Computation: Principles, Processes, and Applications



## Chapter 1: Introduction to Traditional Design



### Section 1.2: Design Process



#### Subsection 1.2c: Final Design



After the design development stage, the final design is created. This is the stage where all the details and elements of the design are finalized and ready for construction. The final design is the result of an iterative process, where the design is continuously refined and improved upon.



One important aspect of the final design is its adherence to the principles of lean product development. Lean product development is a methodology that focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing value in the design process. This approach is particularly relevant in the field of architecture, where efficiency and cost-effectiveness are crucial.



To ensure the final design meets all necessary requirements, it is important to involve all stakeholders in the design process. This includes architects, engineers, contractors, and clients. By involving all parties, potential issues and conflicts can be identified and addressed early on, leading to a smoother construction process.



In addition to traditional design methods, the use of computational tools and techniques plays a significant role in the final design stage. These tools allow for the creation of detailed 3D models and simulations, which aid in visualizing the final product and identifying any potential flaws or challenges.



The final design also takes into consideration various factors such as sustainability, energy efficiency, and accessibility. With the increasing focus on sustainable design, architects must consider the environmental impact of their designs and incorporate sustainable practices into the final design.



In conclusion, the final design is the culmination of the design process, where all elements are refined and integrated to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing design. By utilizing lean product development principles and involving all stakeholders, the final design can meet all necessary requirements and be successfully constructed.

#### Subsection 1.3a: Hand Drafting



Hand drafting has been a fundamental tool in the design process for centuries. It involves creating technical drawings by hand, using tools such as pencils, rulers, and compasses. While computer-aided design (CAD) programs have become increasingly popular, hand drafting remains an important skill for architects and engineers.



One of the main advantages of hand drafting is its flexibility. It allows for quick and easy modifications to be made to the design, without the need for specialized software or equipment. This makes it an ideal tool for early stages of the design process, where ideas are still being explored and refined.



Hand drafting also allows for a more personal touch in the design. The use of different line weights and shading techniques can convey a sense of depth and texture, which may be difficult to achieve with computer-generated drawings. This personal touch can add character and uniqueness to a design.



However, hand drafting also has its limitations. It can be time-consuming and may not be as precise as computer-generated drawings. Additionally, it may be difficult to share and collaborate on hand-drawn designs, as they need to be physically transported or scanned.



To address these limitations, many architects and engineers now use a combination of hand drafting and computer-aided design. This allows for the benefits of both techniques to be utilized, resulting in more efficient and accurate designs.



In addition to hand drafting, other traditional design tools and techniques include physical models, mock-ups, and sketches. These tools allow for a more tactile and interactive approach to the design process, which can be beneficial in understanding the scale and proportions of a design.



As technology continues to advance, new design tools and techniques are constantly emerging. However, it is important for architects and engineers to have a strong foundation in traditional design methods, as they provide a solid framework for the design process.

##### 16.2b.1 Performance Indices



To select the best material for a specific application, engineers and architects use performance indices. These indices are derived from equations that consider the material's properties and the desired performance of the building. For example, for tension, the performance index equation is <math>P_{CR}=\sigma/\rho</math>, where <math>P_{CR}</math> is the performance index, <math>\sigma</math> is the stress, and <math>\rho</math> is the density of the material.



##### 16.2b.2 Log-Log Plotting



To visualize the performance indices, engineers and architects use log-log plots. These plots have a logarithmic scale on both the x and y-axis, making it easier to compare a wide range of values. For example, the tension performance equation <math>P_{CR}=\sigma/\rho</math> can be rearranged to give <math>\log(\sigma) = \log(\rho) + \log(P_{CR})</math>, which follows the format of <math>y = x + b</math> and is linear on a log-log graph. Similarly, the bending performance equation <math>P_{CR}=\sqrt{\sigma}/\rho</math> can be treated similarly and plotted on the Ashby chart.



##### 16.2b.3 Types of Materials



There are various types of materials used in construction, each with its own unique properties and characteristics. Some common materials include carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic. The selection of materials depends on the building's function and the desired performance.
