### Section: 1.1 Human-Centered Systems Engineering Design Approaches:



#### Subsection: 1.1a Introduction to Human-Centered Design



Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a design philosophy that focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user in order to create effective and efficient systems. It is a user-centered approach that takes into account the goals and tasks associated with skill performance in specific work or problem domains. HCD is often contrasted with use-centered design, which places more emphasis on the work domain and its constraints.



The goal of HCD is to create systems that are intuitive, easy to use, and meet the needs of the end user. This is achieved through a deep understanding of the user's needs, preferences, and limitations. HCD involves a user-centered design process that includes research, prototyping, and testing to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the user.



One of the key principles of HCD is the involvement of the end user throughout the design process. This allows for a better understanding of the user's needs and preferences, and ensures that the final product is tailored to their specific requirements. HCD also takes into account the user's cognitive abilities, physical limitations, and emotional responses to the system.



In contrast to the classical 'user-centered' approach, which focuses on the human-interface dyad, HCD takes a triadic semiotic model that includes the work domain as a third component. This means that the work domain provides a ground for meaning outside of the human information processing system. In this triadic system, the focus is on the match between the constraints in the work domain and the mental representations of the user. This allows for the design of displays that shape the user's internal mental representations to conform with the validated 'deep structure' of the work domain.



HCD also incorporates principles from human factors, decision-making, and control theory. These theories help to inform the design process by providing a better understanding of how humans interact with systems and make decisions. By incorporating these theories, HCD aims to create systems that are not only user-friendly, but also efficient and effective.



In the context of Human Supervisory Control of Automated Systems (HSCAS), HCD plays a crucial role in ensuring that the human operator can effectively monitor and control the automated system. By understanding the needs and limitations of the human operator, HCD can help to design interfaces and displays that facilitate skilled interactions between the human and the automated system.



In the next section, we will explore the different types of automated systems that require human supervision and the specific challenges and considerations for HCD in each type. 





### Section: 1.1 Human-Centered Systems Engineering Design Approaches:



#### Subsection: 1.1b Principles of Human-Centered Design



Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a user-centered design philosophy that focuses on creating systems that are intuitive, easy to use, and meet the needs of the end user. In this subsection, we will discuss the principles of HCD and how they contribute to the design of effective and efficient systems.



One of the key principles of HCD is the involvement of the end user throughout the design process. This means that the user is not just a passive recipient of the final product, but an active participant in the design process. By involving the user from the beginning, designers can gain a better understanding of the user's needs, preferences, and limitations. This allows for the creation of systems that are tailored to the specific requirements of the user.



HCD also takes into account the user's cognitive abilities, physical limitations, and emotional responses to the system. This means that the design of the system is not only based on the user's functional needs, but also their psychological and emotional needs. By considering these factors, designers can create systems that are not only efficient and effective, but also enjoyable and satisfying for the user.



Another important principle of HCD is the use of a triadic semiotic model. This model includes the work domain as a third component, in addition to the human and the interface. This means that the work domain provides a ground for meaning outside of the human information processing system. By considering the work domain, designers can create displays that shape the user's internal mental representations to conform with the validated 'deep structure' of the work domain. This allows for a better match between the user's mental model and the actual system, leading to improved performance and reduced errors.



HCD also incorporates principles from human factors, decision-making, and control theory. These theories provide a framework for understanding human behavior and performance, and can be applied to the design of systems to improve usability and effectiveness. For example, human factors principles can be used to design displays and controls that are easy to use and understand, while decision-making and control theory can inform the design of decision support systems and automation.



In summary, the principles of HCD emphasize the importance of understanding the user and their needs, involving the user throughout the design process, and considering the work domain and relevant theories in the design of systems. By following these principles, designers can create systems that are not only efficient and effective, but also user-friendly and satisfying. 





### Section: 1.1 Human-Centered Systems Engineering Design Approaches:



#### Subsection: 1.1c Case Studies in Human-Centered Design



In addition to the principles of Human-Centered Design (HCD) discussed in the previous subsection, it is important to understand how these principles are applied in real-world scenarios. This subsection will explore case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of HCD in the design of automated systems.



One such case study is the design of an automated air traffic control system. In this project, the design team followed the principles of HCD by involving air traffic controllers in the design process. By understanding the needs and limitations of the end users, the team was able to create a system that was intuitive and easy to use. The system also took into account the cognitive abilities and emotional responses of the controllers, resulting in a more efficient and enjoyable work experience.



Another example is the design of a medical device for monitoring patient vital signs. The design team used a triadic semiotic model, considering not only the user and the interface, but also the work domain of healthcare. By understanding the constraints and requirements of the work domain, the team was able to create a device that seamlessly integrated into the workflow of healthcare professionals. This resulted in improved patient care and reduced errors.



These case studies demonstrate the importance of HCD in the design of automated systems. By involving end users, considering their cognitive and emotional needs, and understanding the work domain, designers can create systems that are not only efficient and effective, but also user-friendly and enjoyable to use. This ultimately leads to improved performance and reduced errors, making HCD an essential approach in the design of automated systems.

In behavior modification, task analysis is used to break down complex behavioral sequences into smaller, more manageable steps, which can then be taught and reinforced.



The results of task analysis are often represented in task models, which provide a visual representation of the relationships between different tasks. One example of a notation used to specify task models is ConcurTaskTrees, which is supported by freely available tools. These task models can help designers better understand the flow of tasks and identify potential areas for improvement.



In addition to task analysis, another important aspect of human supervisory control is function allocation. This involves determining which tasks should be performed by humans and which tasks should be automated. This decision is based on a variety of factors, including the capabilities and limitations of humans and machines, the complexity of the task, and the potential consequences of errors.



Function allocation is a critical step in the design of automated systems, as it determines the division of labor between humans and machines. If tasks are not allocated appropriately, it can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and even safety hazards. Therefore, it is important for designers to carefully consider the function allocation process and involve end users in the decision-making process.



In conclusion, task analysis and function allocation are essential components of human supervisory control of automated systems. By understanding the demands and requirements of tasks, designers can create systems that are efficient, effective, and user-friendly. Function allocation ensures that tasks are appropriately divided between humans and machines, leading to improved performance and reduced errors.

### Section: 1.2 Task Analysis and Function Allocation:



#### Subsection: 1.2c Function Allocation in Automated Systems



Function allocation is a critical aspect of designing and implementing automated systems. It involves determining which tasks and functions will be performed by humans and which will be performed by machines. This decision is based on a variety of factors, including the capabilities and limitations of both humans and machines, the complexity of the task, and the potential consequences of errors.



There are several approaches to function allocation, each with its own advantages and limitations. One approach is to allocate functions based on the strengths and weaknesses of humans and machines. For example, tasks that require fine motor skills or decision making may be better suited for humans, while tasks that require speed or precision may be better suited for machines.



Another approach is to allocate functions based on the complexity of the task. Tasks that are simple and routine may be better suited for machines, while tasks that are complex and require judgment and decision making may be better suited for humans.



In some cases, a hybrid approach may be used, where both humans and machines work together to perform a task. This can be particularly useful in tasks that require a combination of physical and cognitive abilities.



Function allocation is not a one-time decision, but rather an ongoing process. As technology advances and tasks change, the allocation of functions may need to be reevaluated. Additionally, as humans and machines work together, their roles and responsibilities may need to be adjusted to optimize performance and safety.



One important consideration in function allocation is the potential for human error. While machines may be more reliable and consistent in performing certain tasks, they are not immune to errors. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential consequences of errors and allocate functions accordingly.



In conclusion, function allocation is a crucial aspect of designing and implementing automated systems. It involves carefully considering the strengths and limitations of both humans and machines, as well as the complexity and potential consequences of tasks. By carefully allocating functions, we can optimize the performance and safety of human supervisory control of automated systems.





## Chapter 1: Human Supervisory Control of Automated Systems:



### Section: 1.3 Historical and Social Implications:



#### Subsection: 1.3a History of Automated Systems



The history of automated systems can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where engineers and inventors sought to create machines that could perform tasks with minimal human intervention. One of the earliest recorded examples is the "Pigeon" created by Archytas of Tarentum in the 4th century BC, which was propelled by steam. However, it was not until the 3rd century BC that the concept of automata was explored in depth by the Greek philosopher Aristotle in his work "Politics". He speculated that automata could one day lead to the abolition of slavery by allowing each instrument to do its own work.



During the Greek control of Egypt, engineers in Alexandria continued to advance the field of automata. Notable figures such as Ctesibius and Hero of Alexandria constructed automata powered by hydraulics and steam, including human-like figures used in religious ceremonies and puppet theaters. These engineers saw automata as a way to demonstrate human control over nature and as a form of reverence for the gods.



In the modern era, the development of automated systems has been driven by the industrial revolution and the need for increased efficiency and productivity. The first industrial robot, the Unimate, was introduced in 1961 and revolutionized the manufacturing industry. Since then, the use of automated systems has expanded to various industries such as transportation, healthcare, and agriculture.



The rapid advancement of technology has also led to the development of more complex and sophisticated automated systems.

### Introduction



In the previous chapter, we discussed the concept of human supervisory control and its importance in the design and operation of automated systems. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the cognitive processes involved in human supervisory control, specifically memory and attention. These two cognitive functions play a crucial role in the successful operation of automated systems, as they allow humans to effectively monitor and control the system's performance.



Memory is the ability to store, retain, and retrieve information. In the context of human supervisory control, memory is essential for monitoring the system's current state and comparing it to previous states to detect any anomalies or errors. It also allows humans to recall past experiences and knowledge to make decisions and take appropriate actions. We will explore the different types of memory and their relevance to human supervisory control.



Attention, on the other hand, is the ability to focus on specific information while ignoring distractions. In the context of human supervisory control, attention is crucial for monitoring the system's performance and detecting any changes or abnormalities. It also allows humans to prioritize and allocate their cognitive resources effectively. We will discuss the different types of attention and their role in human supervisory control.

## Chapter 2: Memory and Attention:



### Section: 2.1 Activity Group Presentations:



In the previous chapter, we discussed the concept of human supervisory control and its importance in the design and operation of automated systems. We also explored the cognitive processes involved in human supervisory control, specifically memory and attention. In this section, we will focus on the role of memory and attention in activity group presentations.



Activity group presentations are a common way for individuals to share their work and ideas with others. These presentations can take various forms, such as oral presentations, poster presentations, or demonstrations. They are often used in academic and professional settings to communicate research findings, project updates, or new products.



### Subsection: 2.1a Planning and Preparing Presentations



Planning and preparing presentations require the use of both memory and attention. Memory is crucial for organizing and storing the information that will be presented. It allows presenters to recall relevant data, facts, and figures to support their arguments and make their presentations more convincing.



Attention is also essential in the planning and preparation stage. It allows presenters to focus on the most critical information and prioritize their content. This is especially important when time constraints are present, and presenters must decide what information to include and what to leave out.



To effectively plan and prepare presentations, presenters must also consider the limitations of memory and attention. For example, memory limitations may make it challenging to remember all the necessary information, leading to a disorganized or incomplete presentation. Attention limitations may result in presenters being unable to focus on the most critical information, leading to a less impactful presentation.



To overcome these limitations, presenters can use various strategies and techniques. For example, they can use visual aids, such as slides or posters, to supplement their verbal presentation and aid in memory recall. They can also use techniques like chunking, which involves breaking down information into smaller, more manageable chunks, to improve memory retention.



In addition to these strategies, presenters can also use their knowledge of memory and attention to engage their audience and make their presentations more effective. For example, they can use storytelling techniques to capture and maintain their audience's attention, or they can use repetition to reinforce key points and improve memory retention.



In conclusion, memory and attention play crucial roles in the planning and preparation of activity group presentations. Presenters must be aware of the limitations of these cognitive functions and use appropriate strategies and techniques to overcome them and deliver impactful presentations.

They can also use mnemonic devices or storytelling techniques to make the information more memorable.



Another important aspect of effective presentations is the use of effective presentation techniques. These techniques can help presenters engage their audience and deliver their message in a clear and compelling manner. Some effective presentation techniques include:



- Using a clear and concise structure: Presenters should have a clear outline of their presentation and follow a logical structure to guide their audience through the information.

- Using appropriate language and tone: Presenters should use language and tone that is appropriate for their audience and the topic being presented. This can help keep the audience engaged and interested.

- Using visual aids: As mentioned earlier, visual aids can be a powerful tool in presentations. They can help presenters convey complex information in a more accessible and engaging way.

- Using storytelling: Storytelling is a powerful way to capture the audience's attention and make the information more relatable. Presenters can use personal anecdotes or case studies to illustrate their points and make the information more memorable.

- Using interactive elements: Incorporating interactive elements such as polls, quizzes, or group activities can help keep the audience engaged and make the presentation more interactive and dynamic.

### Subsection: 2.1c Evaluating Presentations



After planning and preparing a presentation, the next step is to deliver it to an audience. However, before the presentation can be delivered, it is essential to evaluate its effectiveness. Evaluation allows presenters to assess the impact of their presentation and make improvements for future presentations.



Evaluation of presentations also involves the use of memory and attention. Presenters must remember the content of their presentation and how it was delivered to accurately evaluate its effectiveness. Attention is also crucial in evaluating presentations, as it allows presenters to focus on the audience's reactions and feedback.



To effectively evaluate presentations, presenters can use various methods and tools. One common method is to collect feedback from the audience through surveys or questionnaires. These tools can provide valuable insights into the audience's perception of the presentation and areas for improvement.



Another method is to record the presentation and review it later. This allows presenters to observe their delivery and identify areas for improvement, such as body language, tone, or pacing. Additionally, presenters can also ask for feedback from colleagues or mentors to gain a different perspective on their presentation.



It is important to note that the evaluation process should not be limited to the presenter's perspective. The audience's feedback and perception are equally important in evaluating the effectiveness of a presentation. By considering both the presenter's and audience's perspectives, presenters can make informed decisions on how to improve their presentations in the future.



In conclusion, evaluating presentations is a crucial step in the activity group presentation process. It involves the use of memory and attention to accurately assess the presentation's impact and identify areas for improvement. By using various methods and considering both the presenter's and audience's perspectives, presenters can continuously improve their presentation skills and deliver more effective presentations.





## Chapter 2: Memory and Attention:



### Section: 2.2 Classical Decision Theory and Bayes’ Theorem:



### Subsection: 2.2a Introduction to Decision Theory



In the previous section, we discussed the role of memory and attention in evaluating presentations. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of decision theory and its relevance to human supervisory control.



Decision theory is a branch of mathematics and economics that studies how individuals make decisions in the face of uncertainty. It provides a framework for understanding and analyzing decision-making processes, and it has been applied to various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.



One of the fundamental principles of decision theory is the use of utility functions to represent an individual's preferences. These utility functions assign a numerical value to different outcomes, allowing individuals to compare and make decisions based on their preferences.



Bayes' theorem, named after the 18th-century mathematician Thomas Bayes, is a fundamental concept in decision theory. It provides a mathematical framework for updating beliefs and making decisions based on new information. Bayes' theorem has been applied in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and cognitive science.



In the context of human supervisory control, Bayes' theorem can be used to model how individuals make decisions when faced with uncertain situations. It allows individuals to update their beliefs and make decisions based on new information, improving their decision-making process.



One example of the application of Bayes' theorem in human supervisory control is in the evaluation of presentations. As mentioned in the previous section, presenters can collect feedback from the audience through surveys or questionnaires. Bayes' theorem can be used to analyze this feedback and update the presenter's beliefs about the effectiveness of their presentation. This can help presenters make improvements for future presentations and ultimately improve their decision-making process.



In conclusion, decision theory and Bayes' theorem play a crucial role in understanding and improving human supervisory control. By providing a framework for decision-making under uncertainty, they can help individuals make more informed and effective decisions in various contexts, including activity group presentations. 





## Chapter 2: Memory and Attention:



### Section: 2.2 Classical Decision Theory and Bayes’ Theorem:



### Subsection: 2.2b Understanding Bayes’ Theorem



In the previous subsection, we discussed the basics of decision theory and its relevance to human supervisory control. In this subsection, we will delve deeper into one of the fundamental concepts of decision theory - Bayes’ theorem.



Bayes’ theorem is a mathematical formula that provides a framework for updating beliefs and making decisions based on new information. It is named after the 18th-century mathematician Thomas Bayes and has been applied in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and cognitive science.



The formula for Bayes’ theorem is as follows:



$$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$



where $P(B) \neq 0$. This formula may seem complex at first glance, but it can be broken down into simpler components.



First, let’s define the terms used in the formula. $A$ and $B$ represent two events, and $P(A \mid B)$ represents the conditional probability of event $A$ given that event $B$ is true. In other words, it is the probability of event $A$ occurring, taking into account the occurrence of event $B$.



$P(A)$ is the prior probability of event $A$, which represents one’s beliefs about event $A$ before any evidence is taken into account. This prior probability may also incorporate any prior knowledge or information about event $A$.



$P(B \mid A)$ is the likelihood function, which can be interpreted as the probability of event $B$ occurring given that event $A$ is true. It quantifies the extent to which the evidence supports the occurrence of event $A$.



$P(B)$ is the probability of event $B$, which can be calculated using the law of total probability. If $\{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\}$ is a partition of the sample space, then $P(B)$ can be calculated as follows:



$$P(B) = \sum_i P(B \mid A_i)P(A_i)$$



Essentially, Bayes’ theorem allows individuals to update their beliefs about an event after considering new evidence. This is particularly useful in decision-making processes where uncertainty is present.



In the context of human supervisory control, Bayes’ theorem can be applied in various ways. For example, it can be used to model how individuals make decisions when faced with uncertain situations. It can also be used to analyze feedback from the audience in presentations, as mentioned in the previous section. By incorporating Bayes’ theorem, presenters can improve their decision-making process and make more informed decisions based on the feedback received.



In conclusion, Bayes’ theorem is a fundamental concept in decision theory that has various applications in different fields. Its use in human supervisory control can improve decision-making processes and aid in understanding how individuals make decisions in uncertain situations. 





## Chapter 2: Memory and Attention:



### Section: 2.2 Classical Decision Theory and Bayes’ Theorem:



### Subsection: 2.2c Applications of Decision Theory and Bayes’ Theorem



In the previous subsection, we discussed the basics of decision theory and Bayes’ theorem. In this subsection, we will explore some practical applications of these concepts in the context of human supervisory control of automated systems.



One of the key applications of decision theory is in risk assessment and management. By using Bayes’ theorem, individuals can update their beliefs about the likelihood of a certain event occurring based on new information. This can be particularly useful in situations where there is uncertainty or incomplete information, such as in the case of automated systems.



For example, let’s say a human supervisor is responsible for monitoring an automated system that controls the temperature of a chemical reactor. The supervisor has prior knowledge about the system’s performance and has assigned a probability of 0.8 for the system to operate within safe temperature limits. However, the supervisor receives a warning signal indicating that the temperature is rising rapidly. Using Bayes’ theorem, the supervisor can update their belief about the system’s performance and adjust their actions accordingly.



Another application of decision theory and Bayes’ theorem is in predictive maintenance. By analyzing past data and using Bayes’ theorem, individuals can make informed decisions about when to perform maintenance on a system to prevent potential failures. This can help save time and resources by avoiding unnecessary maintenance and reducing the risk of system failures.



Furthermore, decision theory and Bayes’ theorem can also be applied in the field of cognitive science. By understanding how individuals make decisions and update their beliefs, researchers can gain insights into human cognition and behavior. This can have implications for designing more effective human-machine interfaces and improving the overall performance of automated systems.



In conclusion, decision theory and Bayes’ theorem have a wide range of applications in the context of human supervisory control of automated systems. By incorporating these concepts into our decision-making processes, we can make more informed and effective decisions, leading to better performance and safety in automated systems.

### Section: 2.3 Signal Detection Theory, and Information Theory:



### Subsection: 2.3a Basics of Signal Detection Theory



In the previous section, we discussed the classical decision theory and Bayes’ theorem, which are widely used in human supervisory control of automated systems. In this section, we will explore another important concept in this field - Signal Detection Theory (SDT).



SDT is a framework used to analyze and understand how humans make decisions in the presence of uncertainty and noise. It was first introduced in the 1950s by psychologists and has since been applied in various fields, including engineering, medicine, and economics.



The basic premise of SDT is that humans are constantly bombarded with sensory information, and they must make decisions based on this information. However, this information is often noisy and ambiguous, making it challenging to make accurate decisions. SDT provides a way to quantify this uncertainty and analyze how humans make decisions in such situations.



The key components of SDT are the signal and the noise. The signal refers to the information that is relevant to the decision being made, while the noise refers to the irrelevant or distracting information. In the context of human supervisory control of automated systems, the signal could be the warning signal indicating a potential issue with the system, while the noise could be other irrelevant signals or distractions.



To better understand how SDT works, let’s consider an example. Imagine a human supervisor is monitoring a radar system for incoming aircraft. The signal in this case would be the presence of an aircraft, while the noise could be other objects that may appear on the radar screen, such as birds or clouds. The supervisor must make a decision based on the information presented on the radar screen, and SDT provides a framework to analyze this decision-making process.



One of the key concepts in SDT is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the relationship between the hit rate (correctly identifying the signal) and the false alarm rate (incorrectly identifying the noise as a signal). The area under the ROC curve, known as the AUC, is a measure of the overall performance of the decision-making process. A higher AUC indicates better performance, while a lower AUC indicates a higher level of uncertainty and potential for errors.



Another important concept in SDT is the d' (pronounced "d-prime") value, which measures the sensitivity of the decision-making process. A higher d' value indicates a higher ability to distinguish between the signal and the noise, while a lower d' value indicates a higher level of uncertainty and potential for errors.



In summary, SDT provides a framework to analyze and understand how humans make decisions in the presence of uncertainty and noise. It has practical applications in various fields, including human supervisory control of automated systems, and can help improve decision-making processes by quantifying uncertainty and identifying areas for improvement. In the next subsection, we will explore another important concept in this field - Information Theory.





## Chapter 2: Memory and Attention:



### Section: 2.3 Signal Detection Theory, and Information Theory:



### Subsection: 2.3b Introduction to Information Theory



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of Signal Detection Theory (SDT) and how it can be applied to understand human decision-making in the presence of uncertainty and noise. In this section, we will explore another important concept in this field - Information Theory.



Information Theory is a mathematical framework used to quantify the amount of information contained in a signal or a message. It was first introduced by Claude Shannon in the 1940s and has since been widely used in various fields, including communication systems, data compression, and cryptography.



The key concept in Information Theory is the notion of entropy, which measures the uncertainty or randomness of a signal. The higher the entropy, the more uncertain or random the signal is. In the context of human supervisory control of automated systems, entropy can be used to quantify the uncertainty in the information presented to the human supervisor.



One of the fundamental theorems in Information Theory is the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which provides a theoretical limit on the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communication channel without errors. This theorem has important implications for the design of communication systems and can also be applied to understand the limitations of human information processing.



Another important concept in Information Theory is mutual information, which measures the amount of information that two random variables share. It is defined as the reduction in uncertainty of one variable when the other variable is known. Mutual information has several properties, including non-negativity, symmetry, and supermodularity under independence, which make it a useful tool for analyzing the relationship between two variables.



Mutual information can also be expressed in terms of conditional and joint entropy, which provides a deeper understanding of its relationship with entropy. This relationship can be visualized using a Venn diagram, where the formulas for mutual information correspond to the union, difference, and intersection of two sets.



In conclusion, Information Theory provides a powerful framework for understanding the amount of information contained in a signal and its relationship with entropy. It has important applications in human supervisory control of automated systems and can help us design more efficient and effective systems. In the next section, we will explore how Information Theory can be applied to analyze human decision-making in the context of SDT.





## Chapter 2: Memory and Attention:



### Section: 2.3 Signal Detection Theory, and Information Theory:



### Subsection: 2.3c Applications of Signal Detection and Information Theory



In the previous sections, we discussed the basics of Signal Detection Theory (SDT) and Information Theory and how they can be applied to understand human decision-making and quantify the amount of information in a signal. In this section, we will explore some specific applications of these theories in the field of human supervisory control of automated systems.



One of the key applications of SDT and Information Theory is in the design and evaluation of human-machine interfaces. As automated systems become more complex and integrated into various industries, it is crucial to design interfaces that effectively present information to human supervisors. By using SDT and Information Theory, designers can quantify the amount of information being presented and ensure that it is within the limits of human information processing capabilities.



Another important application is in the evaluation of human performance in supervisory control tasks. By using SDT and Information Theory, researchers can analyze the sensitivity and bias of human decision-making and identify areas for improvement. This can lead to the development of training programs and interventions to enhance human performance in supervisory control tasks.



SDT and Information Theory can also be applied to understand the limitations of human information processing in high-stress and high-workload situations. By quantifying the amount of information being presented and the uncertainty in that information, researchers can identify potential sources of error and develop strategies to mitigate them.



In addition, these theories have been used in the development of decision support systems for human supervisors. By understanding the principles of SDT and Information Theory, designers can develop systems that present information in a way that is easily interpretable and actionable for human supervisors.



Overall, the applications of SDT and Information Theory in the field of human supervisory control of automated systems are vast and continue to expand as technology advances. By utilizing these theories, researchers and designers can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of human supervision in automated systems.

### Section: 2.4 Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases:



### Subsection: 2.4a Understanding Heuristics and Biases



In the previous section, we discussed the concepts of Signal Detection Theory (SDT) and Information Theory and their applications in human supervisory control of automated systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the topic of human decision-making and explore the role of heuristics and biases in our judgment under uncertainty.



As mentioned in the related context, heuristics are mental shortcuts that humans use to make decisions quickly and efficiently. These shortcuts are often based on past experiences and patterns, rather than a thorough analysis of the current situation. While heuristics can be useful in certain situations, they can also lead to errors and biases in our decision-making.



One of the most well-known biases is the "anchoring effect", where individuals are influenced by irrelevant numbers when making decisions. This can be seen in experiments where participants are asked to estimate the age of a historical figure, such as Gandhi, based on a given statement. The results show that the estimates are significantly influenced by the statement, even though it has no relevance to the actual age of the historical figure.



Another common heuristic is the availability heuristic, where individuals make judgments based on how easily they can recall examples from their memory. This can lead to overestimating the likelihood of events that are more easily remembered, even if they are not actually more probable. For example, individuals may perceive flying to be more dangerous than driving, simply because plane crashes are more widely publicized and therefore more easily recalled.



These heuristics and biases can have significant implications in the field of human supervisory control of automated systems. In high-stress and high-workload situations, human supervisors may rely on heuristics and fall prey to biases, leading to errors in decision-making. This can have serious consequences, especially in industries where the safety and well-being of individuals are at stake.



To mitigate the impact of heuristics and biases, it is important for human supervisors to be aware of their existence and actively work to counteract them. This can be achieved through training and interventions that focus on improving decision-making skills and reducing reliance on heuristics. Additionally, designers of human-machine interfaces can also play a crucial role in minimizing the effects of heuristics and biases by presenting information in a clear and unbiased manner.



In conclusion, understanding heuristics and biases is essential in comprehending human judgment under uncertainty. By being aware of these cognitive shortcuts and actively working to mitigate their effects, we can improve decision-making in the field of human supervisory control of automated systems.





## Chapter 2: Memory and Attention:



### Section: 2.4 Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases:



### Subsection: 2.4b Impact of Heuristics and Biases on Decision Making



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of heuristics and biases and their role in human decision-making. In this section, we will explore the impact of these heuristics and biases on decision-making in the context of human supervisory control of automated systems.



One of the main challenges in human supervisory control of automated systems is the need for quick and efficient decision-making. In high-stress and high-workload situations, human supervisors may rely on heuristics and biases to make decisions quickly, rather than taking the time to thoroughly analyze the situation. While this may be beneficial in some cases, it can also lead to errors and biases in decision-making.



One example of this is the availability heuristic, where individuals make judgments based on how easily they can recall examples from their memory. In the context of human supervisory control of automated systems, this can lead to overestimating the likelihood of certain events, such as system failures, based on past experiences. This can result in unnecessary interventions or actions that may not be the most effective in the current situation.



Another common heuristic is the representativeness heuristic, where individuals make judgments based on how closely a situation or event resembles a prototype or stereotype. In the context of human supervisory control of automated systems, this can lead to overlooking important information or signals that do not fit the expected prototype. For example, a human supervisor may dismiss a warning signal from the automated system because it does not fit their preconceived notion of what a warning signal should look like.



These heuristics and biases can also have a significant impact on decision-making in uncertain or ambiguous situations. In these situations, individuals may rely on heuristics and biases to make decisions, rather than considering all available information. This can lead to suboptimal decisions and potentially dangerous consequences in the context of human supervisory control of automated systems.



It is important for human supervisors to be aware of these heuristics and biases and their potential impact on decision-making. By understanding and recognizing these biases, human supervisors can take steps to mitigate their effects and make more informed and effective decisions in the context of human supervisory control of automated systems. This may include implementing decision-making strategies that take into account all available information and actively challenging and questioning one's own biases. 





## Chapter 2: Memory and Attention:



### Section: 2.4 Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases:



### Subsection: 2.4c Strategies to Mitigate Heuristics and Biases



In the previous section, we discussed the impact of heuristics and biases on decision-making in the context of human supervisory control of automated systems. These cognitive shortcuts can lead to errors and biases in decision-making, which can have serious consequences in high-stress and high-workload situations. In this section, we will explore strategies to mitigate the effects of heuristics and biases in decision-making.



One approach to mitigating the effects of heuristics and biases is through training and education. By increasing awareness and understanding of these cognitive shortcuts, individuals can learn to recognize and question their own thought processes. This can help them to identify when they are relying on heuristics and biases and to take a step back to consider alternative options.



Another strategy is to implement decision support systems that can assist human supervisors in making decisions. These systems can provide real-time feedback and analysis, helping to reduce the reliance on heuristics and biases. They can also present alternative options and scenarios, allowing human supervisors to make more informed decisions.



In addition, it is important to create a culture that encourages open communication and feedback. This can help to identify and address potential biases and errors in decision-making. By promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement, individuals can work together to mitigate the effects of heuristics and biases.



Furthermore, it is crucial to have a diverse team of individuals involved in the decision-making process. This can help to bring different perspectives and approaches to the table, reducing the reliance on a single individual's biases and heuristics. By promoting diversity and inclusivity, organizations can create a more robust decision-making process.



Lastly, it is important to continuously evaluate and improve decision-making processes. By analyzing past decisions and their outcomes, organizations can identify patterns and biases that may be present. This can help to inform future decision-making and improve overall performance.



In conclusion, while heuristics and biases are natural and often necessary cognitive shortcuts, they can also lead to errors and biases in decision-making. By implementing strategies such as training, decision support systems, open communication, diversity, and continuous evaluation, we can mitigate the effects of heuristics and biases and improve decision-making in the context of human supervisory control of automated systems.

### Section: 2.5 Naturalistic Decision Making:



### Subsection: 2.5a Introduction to Naturalistic Decision Making



Naturalistic decision making (NDM) is a field of study that focuses on how individuals make decisions in real-world, complex situations. Unlike traditional decision-making models that assume a rational and logical approach, NDM recognizes that decision-making is often influenced by a variety of factors, including emotions, intuition, and experience.



NDM is particularly relevant in the context of human supervisory control of automated systems, as it involves high-stress and high-workload situations where decisions must be made quickly and accurately. In these situations, individuals may rely on heuristics and biases, which can lead to errors and biases in decision-making. Therefore, understanding NDM and its implications is crucial for improving decision-making in these critical scenarios.



One key aspect of NDM is the concept of artificial intuition. This refers to the ability of individuals to make quick and accurate decisions based on their experience and expertise, without consciously analyzing all available information. This type of intuition is often developed through years of training and experience, and can be a valuable asset in high-stress decision-making situations.



However, artificial intuition can also be influenced by heuristics and biases, leading to errors in decision-making. For example, the recognition heuristic, which is the tendency to choose the option that is more familiar, can lead to biased decisions in situations where one option is more recognizable but not necessarily the best choice.



To address these potential limitations of artificial intuition, it is important to understand the empirical support and limitations of NDM. The priority heuristic, which is based on the idea that individuals prioritize certain cues over others when making decisions, has been shown to predict the majority choice in one-stage gambles better than other decision-making models. However, it has also been criticized for its inability to explain the heterogeneity of decisions between individuals.



To further explore the support for and limitations of NDM, an adversarial collaboration approach has been taken in recent studies. These studies have provided a comprehensive synopsis of the current state of NDM research, highlighting the need for a cumulative theory integration to better understand decision-making in complex situations.



In addition to understanding the theoretical models of NDM, it is also important to consider the practical implications for decision-making in high-stress and high-workload situations. One approach to mitigating the effects of heuristics and biases is through training and education. By increasing awareness and understanding of these cognitive shortcuts, individuals can learn to recognize and question their own thought processes, leading to more informed decision-making.



Another strategy is the implementation of decision support systems, which can provide real-time feedback and analysis to assist human supervisors in making decisions. These systems can also present alternative options and scenarios, reducing the reliance on heuristics and biases.



Creating a culture that encourages open communication and feedback is also crucial in mitigating the effects of heuristics and biases. By promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement, individuals can work together to identify and address potential biases and errors in decision-making.



Furthermore, having a diverse team of individuals involved in the decision-making process can also help to reduce the reliance on a single individual's biases and heuristics. By promoting diversity and inclusivity, organizations can create a more robust decision-making process.



In conclusion, NDM is a complex and dynamic field of study that has important implications for decision-making in high-stress and high-workload situations. By understanding the theoretical models and practical implications of NDM, individuals can work towards improving decision-making in these critical scenarios.





## Chapter 2: Memory and Attention:



### Section: 2.5 Naturalistic Decision Making:



### Subsection: 2.5b Factors Influencing Naturalistic Decision Making



Naturalistic decision making (NDM) is a field of study that focuses on how individuals make decisions in real-world, complex situations. It recognizes that decision-making is often influenced by a variety of factors, including emotions, intuition, and experience. In this section, we will explore some of the key factors that influence naturalistic decision making.



#### 2.5b.1 Familiarity Heuristic



The familiarity heuristic is a cognitive shortcut that individuals use to make decisions based on the familiarity of an option. It is based on the idea that individuals tend to choose the option that is more familiar, even if it may not be the best choice. This heuristic is often used in situations where individuals are under time pressure or have limited cognitive resources.



However, there has been some criticism of the familiarity heuristic. One study found that the influence of past behavior on present behavior decreased when individuals were distracted, indicating that the familiarity heuristic may not be as prevalent when individuals are under high cognitive strain. This suggests that the familiarity heuristic may not be a reliable decision-making strategy in all situations.



#### 2.5b.2 Effort Heuristic



The effort heuristic is another cognitive shortcut that individuals use to make decisions based on the perceived effort required for a particular option. It is based on the idea that individuals tend to choose the option that requires less effort, even if it may not be the best choice. This heuristic is often used in situations where individuals are under high workload or stress.



A study by Ouellette and Wood (1998) found that the effort heuristic may only be applicable in situations where the target behavior is habitual and occurs in a stable context. This suggests that the effort heuristic may be limited to routine situations and may not be a reliable decision-making strategy in more complex or novel situations.



#### 2.5b.3 Artificial Intuition



Artificial intuition is the ability of individuals to make quick and accurate decisions based on their experience and expertise, without consciously analyzing all available information. This type of intuition is often developed through years of training and experience, and can be a valuable asset in high-stress decision-making situations.



However, artificial intuition can also be influenced by heuristics and biases, leading to errors in decision-making. For example, the recognition heuristic, which is the tendency to choose the option that is more familiar, can lead to biased decisions in situations where one option is more recognizable but not necessarily the best choice.



#### 2.5b.4 Empirical Support and Limitations of NDM



To address the potential limitations of artificial intuition, it is important to understand the empirical support and limitations of NDM. The priority heuristic, which is based on the idea that individuals prioritize certain cues over others when making decisions, has been shown to predict the majority choice in many decision-making scenarios. However, it is not a perfect predictor and may not be applicable in all situations.



In conclusion, naturalistic decision making is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. While heuristics and biases can be useful in certain situations, they can also lead to errors in decision-making. It is important to understand the limitations of these decision-making strategies and to continue researching and developing more effective approaches to decision-making in high-stress and high-workload situations.

### Section: 2.5 Naturalistic Decision Making:



### Subsection: 2.5c Case Studies in Naturalistic Decision Making



Naturalistic decision making (NDM) is a field of study that focuses on how individuals make decisions in real-world, complex situations. It recognizes that decision-making is often influenced by a variety of factors, including emotions, intuition, and experience. In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of NDM in different contexts.



#### 2.5c.1 Decision Making in Emergency Situations



One of the most well-known case studies in NDM is the investigation of decision-making processes in emergency situations. Researchers have studied the decision-making of firefighters, pilots, and other emergency responders to understand how they make split-second decisions in high-stress and unpredictable environments.



For example, a study by Klein (1998) examined the decision-making of experienced firefighters during a wildfire. The results showed that these firefighters relied heavily on their intuition and past experiences to make decisions, rather than following a strict decision-making process. This highlights the importance of experience and expertise in NDM, as well as the role of emotions and intuition in decision-making.



#### 2.5c.2 Decision Making in Military Operations



Another area where NDM has been applied is in military operations. Military decision-making often occurs in complex and uncertain environments, where the consequences of decisions can be life or death. As such, understanding the decision-making processes of military leaders is crucial for improving decision-making in these high-stakes situations.



A case study by Serfaty and Salas (2005) examined the decision-making of military leaders during a simulated combat mission. The results showed that these leaders used a combination of analytical and intuitive decision-making strategies, depending on the complexity of the situation. This highlights the importance of adaptability and flexibility in decision-making, as well as the need for training and experience in NDM.



#### 2.5c.3 Decision Making in Business



NDM has also been applied in the business world, where decision-making often occurs in complex and dynamic environments. A case study by Klein and Klinger (1991) examined the decision-making of CEOs in the computer industry. The results showed that these CEOs relied heavily on their intuition and past experiences to make decisions, rather than following a strict decision-making process.



This highlights the importance of experience and expertise in NDM, as well as the role of emotions and intuition in decision-making. It also suggests that NDM can be applied in a variety of contexts, not just in high-stakes situations like emergency or military operations.



#### 2.5c.4 Decision Making in Sports



NDM has even been applied in the world of sports, where athletes must make split-second decisions in high-pressure situations. A case study by Raab, Johnson, and Heekeren (2007) examined the decision-making of professional soccer players during penalty kicks. The results showed that these players relied on their intuition and past experiences to make decisions, rather than following a strict decision-making process.



This highlights the importance of experience and expertise in NDM, as well as the role of emotions and intuition in decision-making. It also suggests that NDM can be applied in a variety of contexts, not just in high-stakes situations like emergency or military operations.



### Conclusion



These case studies demonstrate the diverse applications of NDM in different contexts. They also highlight the importance of experience, expertise, and adaptability in decision-making, as well as the role of emotions and intuition. By understanding the decision-making processes of individuals in real-world situations, we can improve our understanding of NDM and develop strategies to enhance decision-making in complex and uncertain environments.

### Section: 2.6 Workload and Situation Awareness:



### Subsection: 2.6a Understanding Workload in Automated Systems



In the previous section, we discussed the importance of naturalistic decision making (NDM) in understanding how individuals make decisions in complex and uncertain situations. In this section, we will explore another crucial aspect of human supervisory control of automated systems: workload and situation awareness.



Workload refers to the amount of mental and physical effort required to complete a task. In the context of automated systems, workload can be affected by a variety of factors, including the complexity of the system, the level of automation, and the individual's experience and expertise. Understanding workload is crucial for designing and implementing effective human supervisory control systems, as it can impact decision-making, performance, and overall system effectiveness.



One of the key challenges in understanding workload in automated systems is the dynamic nature of workload. Workload can vary depending on the task, the environment, and the individual's state of mind. This makes it difficult to measure and predict workload accurately. However, researchers have developed various methods and techniques to assess workload, such as subjective ratings, physiological measures, and task performance measures.



One of the most widely used methods for measuring workload is the NASA Task Load Index (TLX). This subjective rating scale assesses workload based on six dimensions: mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration. The TLX has been used in various studies to evaluate workload in different contexts, including aviation, healthcare, and military operations.



Another important aspect of human supervisory control of automated systems is situation awareness (SA). SA refers to the understanding of the current situation and the ability to anticipate future events and make decisions accordingly. In the context of automated systems, SA is crucial for effective decision-making and performance. However, the level of SA can be affected by workload, as high workload can lead to decreased SA and vice versa.



To better understand the relationship between workload and SA, researchers have developed the Workload-Situation Awareness Trade-off (WSAT) model. This model suggests that there is a trade-off between workload and SA, where an increase in workload can lead to a decrease in SA and vice versa. This trade-off can be influenced by various factors, such as task complexity, automation level, and individual differences.



In conclusion, understanding workload and situation awareness is crucial for designing and implementing effective human supervisory control systems for automated systems. Workload can impact decision-making, performance, and overall system effectiveness, while SA is essential for effective decision-making and performance. As such, it is important for researchers and practitioners to continue exploring and developing methods and techniques for assessing and managing workload and SA in the context of automated systems.





## Chapter 2: Memory and Attention:

Situation awareness refers to the understanding of the current situation and the ability to anticipate future events and make decisions accordingly. It is a critical skill for individuals operating in complex and uncertain environments, such as pilots, first responders, and drivers. In the context of automated systems, SA is essential for effective human supervisory control.



One of the key challenges in maintaining SA in automated systems is the potential for information overload. As automated systems become more complex and advanced, they can generate a vast amount of data and information. This can overwhelm the human operator and make it challenging to maintain a clear understanding of the situation. Therefore, it is crucial to design automated systems that present information in a way that is easily digestible and relevant to the task at hand.



Another important aspect of SA is the ability to detect and respond to anomalies or unexpected events. In automated systems, anomalies can occur due to system malfunctions, environmental changes, or human error. Maintaining SA allows the human operator to quickly identify and respond to these anomalies, preventing potential accidents or errors.



Furthermore, SA is crucial for effective decision-making in automated systems. As discussed in the previous section, workload can impact decision-making. However, maintaining SA can help mitigate the effects of workload on decision-making. By understanding the current situation and anticipating future events, the human operator can make informed decisions that are in line with the goals of the system.



In conclusion, situation awareness is a critical aspect of human supervisory control in automated systems. It allows the human operator to understand the current situation, anticipate future events, and make informed decisions. As automated systems continue to advance, it is essential to prioritize SA in the design and implementation of these systems to ensure their safe and effective operation.

#### Automation Transparency



One technique that can help improve workload management and situation awareness is automation transparency. Automation transparency refers to the degree to which the actions and decisions of the automated system are visible and understandable to the human operator. This can be achieved through various means, such as providing real-time feedback on the system's actions, displaying the system's decision-making process, and allowing the operator to intervene or override the system's actions.



By increasing automation transparency, the human operator can better understand the system's behavior and anticipate potential errors or anomalies. This can help reduce workload and improve situation awareness, as the operator can quickly identify and respond to unexpected events.



#### Adaptive Automation



Another technique that can improve workload management and situation awareness is adaptive automation. Adaptive automation refers to the ability of the system to adjust its level of automation based on the operator's workload and situation awareness. This can be achieved through various means, such as adjusting the amount and complexity of information presented to the operator, or shifting control between the human and the automated system.



By adapting to the operator's workload and situation awareness, the system can help reduce cognitive overload and improve decision-making. This can also help maintain situation awareness, as the system can adjust its level of automation to ensure that the operator is not overwhelmed with information.



#### Training and Familiarization



Lastly, proper training and familiarization with the automated system can also help improve workload management and situation awareness. By providing operators with comprehensive training on the system's capabilities, limitations, and potential errors, they can better understand and anticipate the system's behavior. This can help reduce workload and improve situation awareness, as the operator will be more familiar with the system's operations and potential issues.



Furthermore, regular training and familiarization sessions can also help operators stay up-to-date with any changes or updates to the system. This can help prevent errors and improve overall performance in human supervisory control of automated systems.

## Chapter 3: Aircraft Displays and Flight Management Systems



### Section: 3.3 Research Methods and Experimental Design



#### Subsection: 3.3b Understanding Experimental Design



In order to conduct effective empirical research in the field of automation, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of experimental design. Experimental design refers to the process of planning and conducting experiments in a systematic and controlled manner in order to test hypotheses and gather data.



##### Factorial Experiments



One commonly used experimental design in automation research is the factorial experiment. This type of experiment involves manipulating multiple factors simultaneously in order to observe their individual and combined effects on a particular outcome. For example, in the context of aircraft displays and flight management systems, a factorial experiment may involve manipulating factors such as display layout, color scheme, and font size to observe their impact on pilot performance and workload.



The advantage of using a factorial experiment is that it allows for the efficient testing of multiple factors and their interactions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the system being studied. However, as mentioned in the related context, the number of experimental runs required can become operationally difficult when there are many factors involved.



##### Sparsity-of-Effects Principle



In cases where the number of factors is large, the sparsity-of-effects principle can be utilized to simplify the experimental design. This principle states that interactions between more than a certain number of factors (typically three or more) can be assumed to be negligible. This allows for a reduction in the number of experimental runs required, making the design more feasible.



However, it is important to note that this approach may result in a loss of information and may not accurately capture the full complexity of the system being studied. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the number of factors and their potential interactions when utilizing the sparsity-of-effects principle.



##### Replication and Experimental Error



In order to ensure the validity and reliability of experimental results, replication is often used in factorial experiments. This involves repeating the experiment multiple times and comparing the results to assess the level of experimental error. Replication is particularly important in small experiments, where the effects of individual factors may be more difficult to detect.



However, as mentioned in the related context, replication can become operationally difficult when there are many factors involved. In these cases, it may be necessary to assume that certain interactions are negligible and estimate them as an exact zero. This approach may introduce some error, but it allows for a more feasible experimental design.



##### Recursive Design



In cases where there are more than two factors involved, a 2<sup>"k"</sup> factorial experiment can be recursively designed from a 2<sup>"k"−1</sup> factorial experiment. This involves replicating the 2<sup>"k"−1</sup> experiment and assigning the first replicate to the first level of the new factor, and the second replicate to the second level. This recursive design can be generalized to accommodate more than two factors, making it a useful approach for designing factorial experiments with a large number of factors.



Overall, understanding experimental design is crucial for conducting effective empirical research in the field of automation.

Air traffic control (ATC) is a crucial component of the aviation industry, responsible for ensuring the safe and efficient flow of air traffic. In this subsection, we will explore the basics of ATC, including its history, structure, and key functions.



#### History of Air Traffic Control



The need for air traffic control arose in the early 20th century as the number of aircraft in the sky increased. The first air traffic control tower was established in Cleveland, Ohio in 1930, and by the 1950s, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was created to oversee air traffic control in the United States. Today, ATC is a global system, with each country having its own regulatory body responsible for managing air traffic.



#### Structure of Air Traffic Control



ATC is a hierarchical system, with different levels of control responsible for different aspects of air traffic management. At the highest level, there is the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC), which oversees the entire airspace and coordinates with other countries' ATC centers. Below the ATCSCC are the Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), which manage air traffic in specific regions of the country. Finally, there are individual control towers at each airport, responsible for managing the aircraft in their vicinity.



#### Key Functions of Air Traffic Control



The primary function of ATC is to ensure the safe and efficient flow of air traffic. This involves monitoring and controlling the movement of aircraft, providing guidance and instructions to pilots, and coordinating with other ATC centers and airports.

## Chapter 3: Aircraft Displays and Flight Management Systems:



### Section: 3.5 Command and Control/Air Traffic Control:



### Subsection: 3.5c Role of Automation in Command and Control and Air Traffic Control



Automation plays a crucial role in modern aviation, particularly in the areas of command and control and air traffic control. The use of automated aids has increased significantly in recent years, leading to concerns about automation bias and its impact on human performance. In this subsection, we will explore the role of automation in command and control and air traffic control, and the potential implications for human operators.



#### Automation Bias in Command and Control and Air Traffic Control



Automation bias refers to the tendency for human operators to rely too heavily on automated systems, leading to a decrease in their own vigilance and decision-making abilities. This phenomenon has been extensively studied in various fields, including aviation, medicine, process control, and military command and control operations. In the context of aviation, automation bias has been a major concern, particularly in the use of automated aids in the cockpit.



One of the main reasons for automation bias in aviation is the perception of responsibility. Pilots may feel less responsible for the tasks being carried out by automated aids, leading to a decrease in their vigilance and decision-making abilities. This was demonstrated in a study where the presence of a second crewmember in the cockpit did not affect automation bias. Additionally, a study comparing low and high levels of automation (LOA) found that pilots working with a high LOA spent less time reflecting independently on flight decisions.



#### Impact of Automation on Pilot Performance



The use of automation in aviation has both positive and negative effects on pilot performance. On one hand, automation can reduce workload and improve efficiency, allowing pilots to focus on other critical tasks. However, it can also lead to complacency and a decrease in situational awareness. This was evident in a study where pilots with approximately 440 hours of flight experience detected more automation failures than non-pilots, but both groups showed complacency effects.



Furthermore, automation can also lead to a decrease in decision-making skills and an overreliance on automated systems. In a study, all pilots given false automated alerts to shut off an engine did so, despite insisting in an interview that they would not respond in such a manner. This highlights the potential danger of automation bias in critical situations.



#### Role of Automation in Air Traffic Control



In air traffic control, automation is used to assist controllers in managing the flow of air traffic. This includes tasks such as monitoring and controlling the movement of aircraft, providing guidance and instructions to pilots, and coordinating with other ATC centers and airports. Automation can improve efficiency and reduce workload for controllers, but it also introduces the risk of automation bias.



One study found that controllers using automated systems were less likely to detect potential conflicts between aircraft, compared to those using manual systems. This highlights the importance of maintaining situational awareness and not becoming overly reliant on automated systems in air traffic control.



#### Conclusion



In conclusion, automation plays a significant role in command and control and air traffic control in modern aviation. While it can improve efficiency and reduce workload, it also introduces the risk of automation bias, which can have serious implications for human performance. It is essential for operators to maintain vigilance and situational awareness, and not become overly reliant on automated systems. Further research and training are needed to better understand and mitigate the effects of automation bias in these critical areas of aviation.

In the previous subsection, we discussed the concept of model-based programming and its potential applications in the field of aviation. In this subsection, we will delve deeper into the topic by exploring the specific use case of model-based programming in the context of cooperating explorers.



#### Cooperating Explorers



Cooperating explorers refer to a group of explorer ships that work together to achieve a common goal. In the game "Explorers We," players control a group of explorer ships to collect Glynium, a valuable resource. These explorer ships must navigate through a dynamic and uncertain environment, facing various challenges and obstacles along the way.



To effectively navigate through this environment, the explorer ships must cooperate with each other and make decisions based on the information available to them. This is where model-based programming comes into play.



#### Model-based Programming for Cooperating Explorers



In the game "Explorers We," each player starts with three explorer ships, each representing a different race. These explorer ships are color-coded and have different abilities, making them suitable for different tasks. For example, some explorer ships may be better at navigating through asteroid belts, while others may excel at exploring new territories.



To effectively utilize these explorer ships, players can use model-based programming to create a model of each ship's capabilities and limitations. This model can then be used to generate code that allows the explorer ships to make informed decisions based on their individual strengths and weaknesses.



#### Benefits of Model-based Programming for Cooperating Explorers



By using model-based programming, players can create a cohesive and efficient team of cooperating explorers. The model takes into account the individual abilities of each explorer ship and allows them to work together to overcome challenges and achieve their goal of collecting Glynium.



Additionally, model-based programming can also help in decision-making for the players. By having a model of the environment and potential scenarios, players can make informed decisions on which explorer ships to deploy and which tasks to assign to each ship.



#### Conclusion



In this subsection, we have explored the concept of cooperating explorers and how model-based programming can be used to enhance their performance. By creating a model of each explorer ship and their capabilities, players can effectively navigate through the dynamic and uncertain environment of "Explorers We" and achieve their goal of collecting Glynium.

#### Applications of Model-based Programming in Automation



Model-based programming has been widely used in various industries, including factory automation. It allows for the creation of models that represent the behavior and capabilities of different components in a system, which can then be used to generate code for those components. This approach has several benefits, including increased efficiency, improved reliability, and easier maintenance.



One example of model-based programming in automation is the Automation Master, a kinematic chain that is used in factory automation infrastructure. The Automation Master is a software tool that allows for the creation of models for different components in a factory, such as robots, sensors, and conveyor belts. These models can then be used to generate code for these components, making it easier to design and control complex automated systems.



Another application of model-based programming is in the design and control of implicit data structures. These data structures are used to store and manipulate data in a way that is not explicitly defined by the programmer. Model-based programming allows for the creation of models that represent the behavior of these data structures, making it easier to design and implement them in automation systems.



In addition, model-based programming has been applied in real-time object-oriented modeling (ROOM). ROOM is a modeling language that allows for the creation of models for complex systems, such as aircraft displays and flight management systems. These models can then be used to generate code for these systems, making it easier to design and implement them.



### Behavior



In ROOM, each actor has a behavior that is defined by a hierarchical finite-state machine. This state machine consists of states and transitions, which are triggered by incoming messages. The state machine also has a graphical notation similar to UML state charts, making it easier to visualize and understand the behavior of the system.



One of the key benefits of using model-based programming in ROOM is the ability to create a hierarchy of state machines. This allows for the modeling of complex systems with multiple actors and their interactions. The behavior of each actor can be defined by its own state machine, and these state machines can be nested to any depth, allowing for a more comprehensive representation of the system's behavior.



### Further reading



For more information on model-based programming and its applications in automation, we recommend reading publications by Hervé Brönnimann, J. Ian Munro, and Greg Frederickson. These authors have made significant contributions to the field of model-based programming and have published numerous papers and books on the topic.



In addition, the SmartDO software tool has been widely used in industry for model-based programming since 1995. SmartDO allows for the creation of models for complex systems and the generation of code for these systems, making it a valuable tool for automation engineers.



### Conclusion



In this subsection, we have explored some of the applications of model-based programming in automation. From factory automation infrastructure to real-time object-oriented modeling, model-based programming has proven to be a valuable tool for designing and controlling complex automated systems. By creating models that represent the behavior of these systems, engineers can generate code that is more efficient, reliable, and easier to maintain.

UAVs have a long history, with early developments dating back to the early 20th century. However, it was not until the 1990s that UAVs began to see widespread use in military operations. Today, UAVs are used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeted strikes.



One of the key features of UAVs is their autonomy. Basic autonomy is achieved through proprioceptive sensors, which provide information about the aircraft's own state. Advanced autonomy, on the other hand, relies on situational awareness from exteroceptive sensors, which gather information about the environment surrounding the aircraft. This sensor fusion allows for more complex and precise control of the UAV.



### Subsection: 5.8b The Role of Automation in UAVs



Automation plays a crucial role in the operation of UAVs. In fact, UAVs are often referred to as "unmanned" because they are capable of autonomous flight without the need for a human pilot. This autonomy is achieved through the use of multiple control-loop layers, which allow for the decomposition of the aircraft's behavior into manageable "chunks" or states.



One of the most common control mechanisms used in these layers is the PID controller, which uses data from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to calculate precise inputs for the electronic speed controllers and motors. This allows for precise control of the UAV's flight, even in challenging environments.



### Subsection: 5.8c The Integration of UAVs into Human Supervisory Control



The integration of UAVs into human supervisory control of automated systems has become a topic of interest in recent years. As UAV technology continues to advance, there is a growing need for effective and efficient integration of these aircraft into human-controlled systems.



One potential application of UAVs in human supervisory control is in the field of search and rescue operations. UAVs equipped with advanced sensors and cameras can be used to quickly and efficiently search for missing persons or survey disaster areas. The human operator can then use the information gathered by the UAV to make informed decisions and direct rescue efforts.



Another potential application is in the transportation industry. UAVs can be used for delivery services, reducing the need for human-operated vehicles and potentially increasing efficiency and reducing costs. However, the integration of UAVs into the airspace system must be carefully planned and regulated to ensure safety and avoid collisions with other aircraft.



### Subsection: 5.8d Future Trends in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles



As technology continues to advance, the capabilities of UAVs are expected to increase as well. One future trend in UAVs is the development of fully autonomous aircraft that do not require human supervision. These aircraft would be able to make decisions and adapt to changing environments without the need for human input.



Another trend is the use of swarm technology, where multiple UAVs work together to achieve a common goal. This could be particularly useful in disaster response situations, where a swarm of UAVs could quickly survey a large area and provide real-time information to human operators.



In addition, there is ongoing research and development in the area of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAVs. These aircraft would be able to take off and land vertically, making them more versatile and useful in a variety of environments.



Overall, the integration of UAVs into human supervisory control is an exciting and rapidly evolving field. As technology continues to advance, the potential applications and capabilities of UAVs will only continue to grow. It is important for researchers and engineers to work together to ensure safe and effective integration of these aircraft into human-controlled systems.





### Section: 5.9 Standard Flow Abstractions as Mechanisms for Reducing ATC Complexity:



Standard flow abstractions are a powerful tool for reducing the complexity of air traffic control (ATC) systems. These abstractions provide a standardized way of representing and managing the flow of air traffic, allowing for more efficient and effective control of automated systems. In this section, we will explore the concept of standard flow abstractions and their role in reducing ATC complexity.



#### 5.9a Understanding Standard Flow Abstractions



Standard flow abstractions are predefined patterns or templates that represent common sequences of actions in ATC systems. These abstractions are designed to simplify the control of automated systems by providing a high-level view of the flow of air traffic. By using these abstractions, controllers can focus on managing the overall flow of traffic rather than individual aircraft.



One example of a standard flow abstraction is the "takeoff" abstraction. This abstraction represents the sequence of actions that must be taken for an aircraft to safely take off from an airport. It includes tasks such as taxiing to the runway, performing pre-flight checks, and receiving clearance from the control tower. By using this abstraction, controllers can easily manage the takeoff process for multiple aircraft simultaneously, reducing the risk of errors and increasing efficiency.



### Subsection: 5.9b Benefits of Standard Flow Abstractions



The use of standard flow abstractions offers several benefits for ATC systems. First and foremost, these abstractions reduce the complexity of managing air traffic. By providing a high-level view of the flow of traffic, controllers can more easily monitor and control multiple aircraft at once. This reduces the risk of errors and improves the overall efficiency of the system.



Additionally, standard flow abstractions promote consistency and standardization in ATC systems. By using predefined patterns, controllers can ensure that all aircraft are following the same procedures, reducing the potential for confusion or miscommunication. This is especially important in high-stress situations, where clear and consistent communication is crucial for safe and efficient operations.



### Subsection: 5.9c Implementing Standard Flow Abstractions



The implementation of standard flow abstractions in ATC systems requires careful planning and coordination. These abstractions must be designed to accurately represent the flow of air traffic and must be flexible enough to accommodate changes or unexpected events. Additionally, controllers must be trained on how to use these abstractions effectively, as they may require a shift in their traditional methods of managing air traffic.



One challenge in implementing standard flow abstractions is ensuring compatibility with existing systems and procedures. ATC systems are complex and often involve a combination of automated and manual processes. Standard flow abstractions must be integrated seamlessly into these systems to avoid disruptions or conflicts.



### Subsection: 5.9d Conclusion



In conclusion, standard flow abstractions are a valuable tool for reducing the complexity of ATC systems. By providing a high-level view of the flow of air traffic, these abstractions allow for more efficient and effective control of automated systems. However, their implementation requires careful planning and coordination to ensure compatibility with existing systems and procedures. With proper implementation and training, standard flow abstractions can greatly improve the management of air traffic and contribute to safer and more efficient operations.





#### 5.9b Role of Automation in Reducing ATC Complexity



Automation plays a crucial role in reducing the complexity of air traffic control (ATC) systems. As mentioned in the previous section, standard flow abstractions are a powerful tool for reducing ATC complexity. These abstractions provide a standardized way of representing and managing the flow of air traffic, allowing for more efficient and effective control of automated systems. In this subsection, we will explore the specific role of automation in reducing ATC complexity.



One of the main benefits of automation in ATC systems is its ability to handle routine and repetitive tasks. By using standard flow abstractions, controllers can delegate the control of individual aircraft to automated systems, freeing up their time and attention to focus on managing the overall flow of traffic. This reduces the cognitive load on controllers and allows them to make more informed decisions.



Moreover, automation can also assist in reducing the risk of errors in ATC systems. Human error is a major concern in aviation, and automation can help mitigate this risk by taking over routine tasks and providing real-time feedback to controllers. This allows for a more efficient and accurate control of air traffic, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving safety.



Another important role of automation in reducing ATC complexity is its ability to promote consistency and standardization. By using predefined patterns and templates, controllers can ensure that all aircraft are managed in a consistent manner. This not only improves the efficiency of the system but also reduces the risk of errors caused by human factors such as fatigue or distraction.



However, it is important to note that automation is not a perfect solution for reducing ATC complexity. It is crucial for controllers to maintain a high level of situational awareness and be able to intervene in case of any unexpected events or malfunctions. Therefore, it is essential for controllers to receive proper training and have a thorough understanding of the automated systems they are using.



In conclusion, automation plays a vital role in reducing the complexity of air traffic control systems. By using standard flow abstractions, automation can assist in handling routine tasks, reducing the risk of errors, and promoting consistency and standardization. However, it is important for controllers to maintain a high level of situational awareness and be able to intervene when necessary. 





#### 5.9c Future Trends in ATC Complexity Reduction



As technology continues to advance, the role of automation in reducing ATC complexity is expected to grow even further. One of the major future trends in this area is the development of performance-based navigation (PBN) applications. These applications will likely progress from 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional/4-dimensional, allowing for more precise and efficient control of air traffic.



With the implementation of PBN, there will also be a need for on-board performance monitoring and alerting in the vertical plane (vertical RNP). This will further reduce the cognitive load on controllers by automating the monitoring of aircraft performance in the vertical dimension.



Another future trend in ATC complexity reduction is the inclusion of angular performance requirements in PBN. This will allow for more precise control of aircraft during approach and landing, reducing the risk of errors and improving safety.



In addition to PBN, there is ongoing work to harmonize longitudinal and lateral performance requirements. This will allow for a more integrated and standardized approach to managing air traffic, further reducing complexity and improving efficiency.



Furthermore, there is a growing interest in using collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) for air traffic control. CCAs are a group of aircraft that work together to achieve a common goal, such as managing air traffic. This approach has been successfully applied in finding and optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectories, and it is expected to be used in other areas of air traffic control in the future.



Lastly, the use of multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithms (MCACEA) is another promising trend in reducing ATC complexity. This approach divides the problem into smaller sub-problems that are solved simultaneously by different algorithms, allowing for a more efficient and effective control of air traffic.



In conclusion, the future of ATC complexity reduction lies in the continued development and implementation of advanced technologies such as PBN, CCAs, and MCACEA. These advancements will not only improve the efficiency and safety of air traffic control but also reduce the cognitive load on controllers, allowing them to make more informed decisions.

### Section: 6.2 Designing for Human Use:



### Subsection: 6.2a Principles of Design for Human Use



In the previous section, we discussed the importance of understanding human factors in automation. Now, we will explore the principles of design for human use, which can be applied to create effective displays that support perception, situation awareness, and understanding.



#### Perceptual principles



The first two principles of display design, as defined by Christopher Wickens et al., focus on the legibility and avoidance of absolute judgment limits. These principles highlight the importance of making displays easy to read and understand for the user. A display's legibility is critical for designing a usable display. If the characters or objects being displayed cannot be discernible, the operator cannot effectively use them. Similarly, asking the user to determine the level of a variable based on a single sensory variable can lead to errors and confusion. Instead, multiple sensory variables should be used to convey information, reducing the risk of absolute judgment errors.



#### Attention principles



The next set of principles focus on capturing and maintaining the user's attention. These principles include minimizing information access cost, using redundancy gain, and discriminating between information and noise. Minimizing information access cost refers to the effort required by the user to access and process information. This can be achieved by organizing information in a logical and intuitive manner, reducing the cognitive load on the user. Redundancy gain refers to the use of multiple displays or modalities to convey the same information, increasing the likelihood of the user receiving and understanding the information. Discriminating between information and noise is crucial in avoiding information overload and ensuring that only relevant information is presented to the user.



#### Mental model principles



The final set of principles focus on the user's mental model and how it can be supported by the display design. These principles include compatibility, minimization of information processing, and providing predictive aids. Compatibility refers to the consistency between the display and the user's mental model. This can be achieved by using familiar symbols and terminology, reducing the cognitive effort required to understand the display. Minimization of information processing refers to the reduction of extraneous information and the presentation of only essential information to the user. This helps to avoid information overload and allows the user to focus on critical information. Providing predictive aids, such as trend indicators or alarms, can help the user anticipate future events and make informed decisions.



By applying these principles of design for human use, we can create displays that are easy to use, support the user's mental model, and minimize the risk of errors. However, it is essential to note that these principles may not apply to all displays or situations. Designers must strike a functional balance among the principles to create an effective display that meets the specific needs of the user and the task at hand.

The goal of automation is to replace human action and manual command-response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands. However, this does not mean that humans are completely removed from the process. In fact, humans still play a crucial role in the operation and supervision of automated systems. Therefore, it is essential to design these systems with the human user in mind.



Designing for human use in automation involves understanding the capabilities and limitations of human operators and incorporating this knowledge into the design process. This includes considering factors such as perception, attention, and mental models, as well as the overall user experience.



#### Importance of Human-Centered Design



Human-centered design is a design approach that prioritizes the needs and abilities of the human user. This approach is crucial in automation, as it ensures that the system is designed to support and enhance the human operator's performance. By considering the human user in the design process, we can create systems that are intuitive, easy to use, and promote efficient and effective decision-making.



#### Designing for Safety and Reliability



In addition to considering the human user, design in automation must also prioritize safety and reliability. Automated systems are often used in high-risk environments, such as manufacturing facilities or transportation systems, where errors can have severe consequences. Therefore, it is essential to design these systems with safety and reliability in mind, incorporating fail-safe mechanisms and redundancies to prevent accidents and errors.



#### Challenges in Designing for Human Use in Automation



Designing for human use in automation can be challenging due to the complexity of the systems and the diverse range of human operators. It requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving experts in human factors, engineering, and psychology. Additionally, as technology continues to advance, designers must constantly adapt and update their designs to keep up with the changing capabilities and limitations of both the technology and the human user.



#### Conclusion



In conclusion, the role of design in automation is crucial in creating systems that are safe, reliable, and easy to use for human operators. By incorporating human-centered design principles and considering the capabilities and limitations of the human user, we can create automated systems that enhance human performance and decision-making.

One example of indirect control is the use of autopilot systems in airplanes. These systems use sensors and algorithms to control the plane's movements, allowing the pilot to focus on other tasks. Another example is the use of cruise control in cars, where the vehicle's speed is automatically controlled by the system. In both cases, the human operator still has the ability to take over control if necessary, but the automated system is responsible for the majority of the vehicle's movements.



#### Subsection: 8.1b Levels of Human Supervision in Transportation Automation



In addition to understanding the types of transportation automation, it is also essential to consider the levels of human supervision involved. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has defined six levels of automation, ranging from no automation (Level 0) to full automation (Level 5). These levels are based on the amount of human intervention required in the operation of the vehicle.



At Level 0, there is no automation, and the human operator is responsible for all aspects of the vehicle's operation. At Level 1, there is limited automation, such as the use of cruise control, where the human operator is still responsible for most of the vehicle's movements. At Level 2, there is partial automation, where the automated system can control some aspects of the vehicle's movements, but the human operator is still required to monitor and intervene if necessary.



Levels 3, 4, and 5 involve higher levels of automation, with the automated system taking on more responsibility for the vehicle's movements. At Level 3, the automated system can handle most driving tasks, but the human operator must be ready to take over control when necessary. At Level 4, the automated system can handle all driving tasks in certain conditions, while at Level 5, the system can handle all driving tasks in all conditions, without any human intervention.
