# Modeling Dynamics and Control II":





## Foreward



Welcome to "Modeling Dynamics and Control II"! This book serves as a continuation of our previous work, "Modeling Dynamics and Control I", and delves deeper into the world of dynamic systems and control theory. In this book, we will explore the extended Kalman filter, a powerful tool for state estimation in continuous-time systems.



As we know, most physical systems are represented by continuous-time models, but in practice, we often take discrete-time measurements for state estimation. This is where the extended Kalman filter comes in, allowing us to combine the continuous-time model with discrete-time measurements to accurately estimate the state of a system.



In this book, we will first introduce the generalizations of the extended Kalman filter, including the continuous-time version. We will then dive into the details of the extended Kalman filter, discussing its model, initialization, and predict-update steps. We will also explore the differences between the continuous-time and discrete-time versions of the extended Kalman filter, highlighting the importance of understanding both.



Throughout the book, we will provide examples and exercises to help solidify your understanding of the extended Kalman filter. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students and researchers in the field of dynamic systems and control theory.



We would like to thank the MIT community for their support and feedback during the writing of this book. We hope that "Modeling Dynamics and Control II" will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in this field and inspire future research and innovation.



Happy reading!



Sincerely,



[Your Name]





## Chapter: Modeling Dynamics and Control II



### Introduction



In this chapter, we will be exploring the topic of uniaxial motion. This is an important concept in the field of dynamics and control as it involves the movement of a single object along a single axis. We will be discussing the various aspects of uniaxial motion, including its mathematical representation, equations of motion, and control strategies.



Uniaxial motion is a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and control. It is often used to model the behavior of systems such as vehicles, robots, and machines. By understanding the principles of uniaxial motion, we can gain insights into the behavior of these systems and develop effective control strategies to improve their performance.



In this chapter, we will begin by discussing the mathematical representation of uniaxial motion. This will involve the use of variables and equations to describe the position, velocity, and acceleration of a moving object. We will also explore the concept of forces and how they affect the motion of an object.



Next, we will delve into the equations of motion for uniaxial motion. These equations describe the relationship between the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object and the forces acting upon it. We will discuss the different types of forces that can affect uniaxial motion and how they can be modeled mathematically.



Finally, we will explore control strategies for uniaxial motion. These strategies involve using external forces to manipulate the motion of an object and achieve a desired outcome. We will discuss various control techniques, such as feedback control and feedforward control, and how they can be applied to uniaxial motion systems.



By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the principles of uniaxial motion and how it can be modeled and controlled. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for further exploration into more complex dynamics and control topics. So let's dive in and begin our journey into the world of uniaxial motion.

## Chapter 1: Uniaxial Motion



### Section 1.1: Fixed-axis Rotation



### Subsection 1.1a: Introduction to Fixed-axis Rotation



In the previous chapter, we discussed the mathematical representation of uniaxial motion and its equations of motion. In this section, we will focus on a specific type of uniaxial motion known as fixed-axis rotation.



Fixed-axis rotation is a type of motion where an object rotates around a fixed axis. This type of motion is commonly seen in systems such as spinning tops, gyroscopes, and satellites in orbit. It is an important concept in dynamics and control as it allows us to model and analyze the behavior of rotating systems.



To understand fixed-axis rotation, we first need to introduce the concept of rotation formalisms in three dimensions. These formalisms are mathematical representations of rotation and are used to describe the orientation of an object in three-dimensional space.



One of the most commonly used rotation formalisms is the axis-angle representation. This representation involves using an axis vector and an angle to describe the orientation of an object. The axis vector, denoted as <math>{a} = [{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>, represents the direction of the axis of rotation, while the angle represents the magnitude of the rotation.



In the context of fixed-axis rotation, the axis vector is normalized, meaning its length is equal to 1. This is known as Poinsot's ellipsoid and is used to visualize the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit.



Now, let's discuss the applications of Poinsot's construction. As mentioned earlier, it is commonly used in visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. It is also used in other applications such as robotics, where it can be used to model the rotation of robotic arms and joints.



Moving on, let's explore how we can compute the basis matrix for fixed-axis rotation. This matrix is used to transform a vector from one coordinate system to another. In the case of fixed-axis rotation, it is used to transform a vector from the body-fixed frame to the inertial frame.



To compute the basis matrix, we first need to define the input vector <math>{Q}=[{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>. This vector represents the orientation of the object in the body-fixed frame. Using this vector, we can compute the resulting matrix as follows:



$$

\begin{bmatrix}

1 - 2 q_j^2 - 2 q_k^2 & 2(q_i q_j - q_k q_r) & 2(q_i q_k + q_j q_r)\\

2(q_i q_j + q_k q_r) & 1 - 2 q_i^2 - 2q_k^2 & 2(q_j q_k - q_i q_r)\\

2(q_i q_k - q_j q_r) & 2(q_j q_k + q_i q_r) & 1 - 2 q_i^2 - 2 q_j^2

\end{bmatrix}

$$



Alternatively, we can use an alternate basis calculation method. This method involves converting the input vector <math>{A} = [X, Y ,Z] </math> to an angle-axis representation, where <math> \theta = \|A\| </math> and <math>[x,y,z] = \frac {A} {\|A\|} </math>. Using this representation, we can compute the basis matrix as follows:



$$

\begin{bmatrix}

\cos \theta+x_x & x_y + w_z & w_y + x_z \\

\cos \theta+x^2 (1-\cos \theta) & xy(1-\cos \theta) - z\sin \theta & y\sin \theta + xz(1-\cos \theta) \\

xz(1-\cos \theta) - y\sin \theta & x\sin \theta + yz(1-\cos \theta) & \cos \theta+z^{2}(1-\cos \theta)

\end{bmatrix}

$$



Now, let's discuss vector rotation in the context of fixed-axis rotation. Vector rotation involves rotating a vector <math>v = (X, Y, Z) </math> around the rotation vector <math> Q = (X,Y,Z) </math>. The angle of rotation is given by <math> {\theta} = {\|Q\|} </math>.



To rotate the vector, we use the following equation:



$$

v' = \cos \theta v + \sin \theta (Q \times v) + (1 - \cos \theta)(Q \cdot v)Q

$$



where <math> Q \times v </math> represents the cross product between the rotation vector and the vector to be rotated, and <math> Q \cdot v </math> represents the dot product between the rotation vector and the vector to be rotated.



In conclusion, fixed-axis rotation is an important concept in the study of dynamics and control. It allows us to model and analyze the behavior of rotating systems and is commonly used in various applications such as robotics and spacecraft. In the next section, we will explore another type of uniaxial motion known as translation.

## Chapter 1: Uniaxial Motion



### Section 1.1: Fixed-axis Rotation



### Subsection 1.1b: Applications of Fixed-axis Rotation



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of fixed-axis rotation and its mathematical representation using the axis-angle formalism. Now, let's explore some of the applications of fixed-axis rotation in more detail.



One of the most common applications of fixed-axis rotation is in visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. As mentioned earlier, Poinsot's ellipsoid is used to represent the rotation of a spacecraft in three-dimensional space. This visualization technique is crucial in understanding the dynamics and control of spacecraft in orbit.



Fixed-axis rotation is also widely used in robotics. In robotics, it is used to model the rotation of robotic arms and joints. This is essential in designing and controlling robotic systems, as it allows engineers to accurately predict the behavior of the system.



Another application of fixed-axis rotation is in computer graphics. It is used to rotate objects in three-dimensional space, allowing for realistic and dynamic animations. This is achieved by using the basis matrix computation, which we will discuss in the next section.



Furthermore, fixed-axis rotation is also used in physics and engineering to model the motion of rigid bodies. By understanding the principles of fixed-axis rotation, engineers can accurately predict the behavior of rotating systems and design control systems to achieve desired motion.



In conclusion, fixed-axis rotation is a fundamental concept in dynamics and control, with various applications in different fields. Its mathematical representation using the axis-angle formalism and the basis matrix computation allows for accurate modeling and analysis of rotating systems. In the next section, we will dive deeper into the basis matrix computation and its role in fixed-axis rotation.

## Chapter 1: Uniaxial Motion



### Section 1.1: Fixed-axis Rotation



### Subsection 1.1c: Challenges in Fixed-axis Rotation



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of fixed-axis rotation and its mathematical representation using the axis-angle formalism. We also explored some of the applications of fixed-axis rotation in various fields. However, despite its widespread use, fixed-axis rotation poses some challenges that must be addressed in order to accurately model and control rotating systems.



One of the main challenges in fixed-axis rotation is dealing with singularities. Singularities occur when the rotation axis is aligned with one of the coordinate axes, resulting in a division by zero in the axis-angle representation. This can lead to inaccuracies in the rotation calculations and must be carefully handled in order to avoid errors.



Another challenge is the computational complexity of the basis matrix computation. As mentioned in the previous section, the basis matrix is used to rotate vectors in three-dimensional space. However, the computation of this matrix involves trigonometric functions and can be computationally expensive, especially for real-time applications.



Furthermore, the axis-angle representation of fixed-axis rotation can be difficult to visualize and understand, especially for complex rotations. This can make it challenging to interpret and analyze the behavior of rotating systems, particularly for those without a strong mathematical background.



To address these challenges, alternative rotation formalisms have been developed, such as the quaternion representation. Quaternions offer a more compact representation of rotations and do not suffer from singularities. However, they also have their own set of challenges, such as the difficulty in visualizing and interpreting rotations in quaternion form.



In conclusion, while fixed-axis rotation is a fundamental concept in dynamics and control, it is not without its challenges. Careful consideration must be given to singularities, computational complexity, and alternative representations in order to accurately model and control rotating systems. In the next section, we will explore some of these alternative representations and their advantages and disadvantages.

## Chapter 1: Uniaxial Motion



### Section 1.2: First and Second Order Systems



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of fixed-axis rotation and its challenges. In this section, we will shift our focus to another important topic in dynamics and control: first and second order systems.



First and second order systems are mathematical models used to describe the behavior of physical systems. They are commonly used in various fields, such as engineering, physics, and economics, to understand and predict the dynamics of systems.



#### Understanding First Order Systems



A first order system is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of a system with a single energy storage element, such as a capacitor or an inductor. It is represented by a first order differential equation, which relates the input and output of the system.



The general form of a first order differential equation is given by:



$$

\dot{x}(t) = ax(t) + bu(t)

$$



where $x(t)$ is the state of the system, $u(t)$ is the input, and $a$ and $b$ are constants.



The solution to this differential equation is given by:



$$

x(t) = x(0)e^{at} + \frac{b}{a}(e^{at} - 1)u(t)

$$



where $x(0)$ is the initial state of the system.



One of the key characteristics of first order systems is their response to a step input. A step input is a sudden change in the input of the system. The response of a first order system to a step input is given by:



$$

x(t) = x(0)e^{at} + \frac{b}{a}(e^{at} - 1)u_0

$$



where $u_0$ is the magnitude of the step input.



From this equation, we can see that the response of a first order system to a step input depends on the initial state of the system and the time constant $a$. The time constant is a measure of how quickly the system responds to changes in the input.



In conclusion, first order systems are important mathematical models that are used to describe the behavior of physical systems with a single energy storage element. They are characterized by a first order differential equation and their response to a step input depends on the initial state of the system and the time constant. In the next section, we will explore second order systems and their applications.

$$



where $x(t)$ is the state of the system, $u(t)$ is the input, and $a$ and $b$ are constants.



The solution to this differential equation is given by:



$$

x(t) = x(0)e^{at} + \frac{b}{a}(e^{at} - 1)u(t)

$$



where $x(0)$ is the initial state of the system.



One of the key characteristics of first order systems is their response to a step input. A step input is a sudden change in the input of the system. The response of a first order system to a step input is given by:



$$

x(t) = x(0)e^{at} + \frac{b}{a}(e^{at} - 1)u_0

$$



where $u_0$ is the magnitude of the step input.



From this equation, we can see that the response of a first order system to a step input depends on the initial state of the system and the time constant $a$. The time constant is a measure of how quickly the system responds to changes in the input.



In practical applications, first order systems are often used to model physical systems with a single energy storage element, such as a simple RC circuit. They are also commonly used in control systems, where they can be used to model the dynamics of a system and design controllers to regulate its behavior.



#### Understanding Second Order Systems



While first order systems are useful for modeling simple systems, many real-world systems are more complex and require a higher order model. Second order systems are mathematical models that describe the behavior of systems with two energy storage elements, such as a mass-spring-damper system.



The general form of a second order differential equation is given by:



$$

\ddot{x}(t) = ax(t) + bu(t)

$$



where $x(t)$ is the state of the system, $u(t)$ is the input, and $a$ and $b$ are constants.



The solution to this differential equation is given by:



$$

x(t) = x(0)e^{at} + \frac{b}{a}(e^{at} - 1)u(t)

$$



where $x(0)$ is the initial state of the system.



Similar to first order systems, the response of a second order system to a step input depends on the initial state of the system and the time constant $a$. However, second order systems also have an additional parameter, known as the damping ratio, which affects the system's response.



In conclusion, first and second order systems are important mathematical models used to describe the behavior of physical systems. While first order systems are useful for modeling simple systems, second order systems are necessary for more complex systems. Understanding these models is crucial for designing and analyzing control systems in various fields.

x(t) = x(0)e^{at} + \frac{b}{a}(e^{at} - 1)u_0

$$



where $u_0$ is the magnitude of the step input.



From this equation, we can see that the response of a first order system to a step input depends on the initial state of the system and the time constant $a$. The time constant is a measure of how quickly the system responds to changes in the input.



In practical applications, first order systems are often used to model physical systems with a single energy storage element, such as a simple RC circuit. They are also commonly used in control systems, where they can represent the dynamics of a system's response to a control input.



#### Understanding Second Order Systems



While first order systems are useful for modeling systems with a single energy storage element, many physical systems require a more complex model. This is where second order systems come in.



A second order system is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of a system with two energy storage elements. It is represented by a second order differential equation, which relates the input and output of the system.



The general form of a second order differential equation is given by:



$$

\ddot{x}(t) = ax(t) + bu(t)

$$



where $x(t)$ is the state of the system, $u(t)$ is the input, and $a$ and $b$ are constants.



The solution to this differential equation is given by:



$$

x(t) = x(0)e^{at} + \frac{b}{a}(e^{at} - 1)u(t)

$$



where $x(0)$ is the initial state of the system.



Similar to first order systems, the response of a second order system to a step input depends on the initial state of the system and the time constant $a$. However, second order systems also have an additional parameter, known as the damping ratio, which affects the system's response.



The damping ratio is a measure of how much the system's response is affected by its own inertia. A higher damping ratio results in a slower response, while a lower damping ratio results in a faster response.



In practical applications, second order systems are often used to model more complex physical systems, such as a mass-spring-damper system. They are also commonly used in control systems, where they can represent the dynamics of a system's response to a control input.



### Comparing First and Second Order Systems



Now that we have a better understanding of first and second order systems, let's compare them. One key difference between the two is the number of energy storage elements they can model. First order systems can only model systems with a single energy storage element, while second order systems can model systems with two energy storage elements.



Another difference is the complexity of their differential equations. First order systems have a first order differential equation, while second order systems have a second order differential equation. This means that second order systems require more information to fully describe their behavior.



Additionally, the response of first and second order systems to a step input is different. First order systems have a single time constant that affects their response, while second order systems have both a time constant and a damping ratio that affect their response.



In summary, first and second order systems are both important mathematical models used in dynamics and control. While first order systems are simpler and can only model systems with a single energy storage element, second order systems are more complex and can model systems with two energy storage elements. Understanding the differences between these two types of systems is crucial for accurately modeling and predicting the behavior of physical systems.

### Section 1.3: Natural and Forced Response



In the previous section, we discussed first and second order systems and their applications in modeling physical systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the behavior of these systems by examining their natural and forced responses.



#### Understanding Natural Response



The natural response of a system refers to its behavior without any external input or disturbance. It is solely determined by the initial conditions of the system and its inherent dynamics. In other words, it is the response of the system to its own internal energy.



To better understand the natural response of a system, let's consider the example of a simple RC circuit. In this circuit, the capacitor and resistor are the energy storage elements, and the input is the voltage source. When the voltage source is disconnected, the circuit is left to discharge on its own. This discharge is the natural response of the system.



The natural response of a first order system can be described by the following differential equation:



$$

\dot{x}(t) = ax(t)

$$



where $x(t)$ is the state of the system and $a$ is the time constant. The solution to this equation is given by:



$$

x(t) = x(0)e^{at}

$$



From this equation, we can see that the natural response of a first order system decays exponentially with time. The time constant $a$ determines the rate of decay, with a larger value resulting in a slower decay.



#### Understanding Forced Response



The forced response of a system refers to its behavior when an external input or disturbance is applied. This input can be in the form of a step, ramp, or any other type of signal. The forced response is dependent on both the input and the initial conditions of the system.



In the case of a first order system, the forced response can be described by the following differential equation:



$$

\dot{x}(t) = ax(t) + bu(t)

$$



where $x(t)$ is the state of the system, $u(t)$ is the input, and $a$ and $b$ are constants. The solution to this equation is given by:



$$

x(t) = x(0)e^{at} + \frac{b}{a}(e^{at} - 1)u(t)

$$



From this equation, we can see that the forced response of a first order system is a combination of the natural response and the input. The initial state of the system and the time constant $a$ also play a role in determining the behavior of the forced response.



In practical applications, understanding the natural and forced responses of a system is crucial in designing control systems. By analyzing these responses, engineers can determine the stability and performance of a system and make necessary adjustments to achieve desired outcomes.



In the next section, we will explore the concept of stability in more detail and its importance in control systems.





# Modeling Dynamics and Control II



## Chapter 1: Uniaxial Motion



### Section 1.3: Natural and Forced Response



In the previous section, we discussed the natural and forced responses of first and second order systems. In this section, we will further explore the forced response and its implications in modeling dynamics and control.



#### Understanding Forced Response



The forced response of a system is the behavior that results from an external input or disturbance. This input can be in the form of a step, ramp, or any other type of signal. The forced response is dependent on both the input and the initial conditions of the system.



To better understand the forced response, let's consider the example of a mass-spring-damper system. In this system, the input is the external force applied to the mass, and the output is the displacement of the mass. The forced response of this system can be described by the following differential equation:



$$

m\ddot{x}(t) + c\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) = F(t)

$$



where $m$ is the mass, $c$ is the damping coefficient, $k$ is the spring constant, and $F(t)$ is the external force. The solution to this equation is given by:



$$

x(t) = x_n(t) + x_f(t)

$$



where $x_n(t)$ is the natural response and $x_f(t)$ is the forced response. The forced response can be further broken down into two components: the steady-state response and the transient response.



The steady-state response is the long-term behavior of the system after it has reached a stable state. It is determined by the input and the system's transfer function, which describes the relationship between the input and output of the system. The transient response, on the other hand, is the short-term behavior of the system as it approaches the steady state. It is determined by the initial conditions of the system and the system's natural response.



#### Understanding the Relationship Between Natural and Forced Response



The natural and forced responses of a system are closely related. In fact, the forced response can be thought of as the sum of the natural response and the response due to the input. This relationship can be seen in the following equation:



$$

x_f(t) = x_n(t) + x_i(t)

$$



where $x_i(t)$ is the response due to the input. This equation highlights the importance of understanding the natural response of a system in order to accurately model its behavior under external inputs.



In the next section, we will explore the concept of transfer functions and how they can be used to analyze and design control systems. 





# Modeling Dynamics and Control II



## Chapter 1: Uniaxial Motion



### Section 1.3: Natural and Forced Response



In the previous section, we discussed the natural and forced responses of first and second order systems. We explored how the natural response is determined by the system's initial conditions and how the forced response is determined by both the input and the initial conditions. In this section, we will further explore the forced response and its implications in modeling dynamics and control.



#### Understanding Forced Response



The forced response of a system is the behavior that results from an external input or disturbance. This input can be in the form of a step, ramp, or any other type of signal. The forced response is dependent on both the input and the initial conditions of the system.



To better understand the forced response, let's consider the example of a mass-spring-damper system. In this system, the input is the external force applied to the mass, and the output is the displacement of the mass. The forced response of this system can be described by the following differential equation:



$$

m\ddot{x}(t) + c\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) = F(t)

$$



where $m$ is the mass, $c$ is the damping coefficient, $k$ is the spring constant, and $F(t)$ is the external force. The solution to this equation is given by:



$$

x(t) = x_n(t) + x_f(t)

$$



where $x_n(t)$ is the natural response and $x_f(t)$ is the forced response. The forced response can be further broken down into two components: the steady-state response and the transient response.



The steady-state response is the long-term behavior of the system after it has reached a stable state. It is determined by the input and the system's transfer function, which describes the relationship between the input and output of the system. The transient response, on the other hand, is the short-term behavior of the system as it approaches the steady state. It is determined by the initial conditions of the system and the system's natural response.



#### Understanding the Relationship Between Natural and Forced Response



The natural and forced responses of a system are closely related. In fact, the forced response can be seen as a combination of the natural response and the input. This can be seen in the equation for the forced response, where the natural response and the input are added together. This relationship is important in understanding how the input affects the behavior of the system.



For example, if the input is a step function, the steady-state response will eventually reach a constant value, while the transient response will show a change in behavior before reaching the steady state. This change in behavior is due to the natural response of the system, which is dependent on the initial conditions. On the other hand, if the input is a sinusoidal function, the steady-state response will also be sinusoidal, while the transient response will show oscillations before reaching the steady state. Again, this behavior is due to the combination of the natural response and the input.



#### Comparing Natural and Forced Response



Now that we understand the relationship between natural and forced response, let's compare them in more detail. The natural response is solely determined by the initial conditions of the system, while the forced response is determined by both the input and the initial conditions. This means that the natural response is unique to each system, while the forced response can vary depending on the input.



Another difference between the two responses is their behavior over time. The natural response will eventually decay to zero, while the forced response will continue to exist as long as the input is present. This is because the natural response is dependent on the system's inherent properties, while the forced response is influenced by external factors.



In terms of stability, the natural response can be stable, unstable, or marginally stable, depending on the system's properties. On the other hand, the forced response can be stable or unstable, depending on the input. This is an important consideration in control systems, as the stability of the forced response can be controlled by adjusting the input.



In conclusion, the natural and forced responses of a system are closely related but have distinct differences. Understanding these differences is crucial in modeling dynamics and control, as it allows us to predict and manipulate the behavior of a system.

## Chapter: Modeling Dynamics and Control II



### Introduction



In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of modeling dynamics and control, including the use of differential equations and transfer functions. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the concept of impulse response, which is a fundamental tool in the analysis and design of dynamic systems. 



The impulse response of a system is the output of the system when an impulse input is applied. An impulse input is a short, high-intensity signal that is applied for a very brief period of time. This type of input is often used in control systems to test the response of a system to a sudden change or disturbance. 



In this chapter, we will explore the properties of impulse response, including its relationship to the transfer function and its use in determining system stability and performance. We will also discuss how to obtain the impulse response of a system using various methods, such as analytical solutions and numerical simulations. 



Furthermore, we will cover the concept of convolution, which is a mathematical operation used to calculate the output of a system for any given input signal. Convolution is closely related to impulse response and is an essential tool in the analysis of dynamic systems. 



Overall, understanding impulse response is crucial for modeling and controlling dynamic systems. It allows us to predict the behavior of a system and design controllers that can effectively regulate its response. So, let's dive into the world of impulse response and discover its significance in the field of dynamics and control.

## Chapter 2: Impulse Response



### Section 2.1: Collisions



Collisions are a common occurrence in dynamic systems, and understanding their behavior is crucial for modeling and controlling these systems. In this section, we will explore the concept of collisions and their implications in the context of impulse response.



#### Subsection 2.1a: Introduction to Collisions



Collisions can be classified into two types: elastic and inelastic. In an elastic collision, the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved, while in an inelastic collision, some of the kinetic energy is lost. For the purpose of this section, we will focus on elastic collisions.



In a two-dimensional collision with two moving objects, the final velocities of the objects can be calculated using the following equations:



$$

v'_{1x} = \frac{v_{1}\cos(\theta_1-\varphi)(m_1-m_2)+2m_2v_{2}\cos(\theta_2-\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}\cos(\varphi)+v_{1}\sin(\theta_1-\varphi)\cos(\varphi + \tfrac{\pi}{2})

\\[0.8em]

v'_{1y} = \frac{v_{1}\cos(\theta_1-\varphi)(m_1-m_2)+2m_2v_{2}\cos(\theta_2-\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}\sin(\varphi)+v_{1}\sin(\theta_1-\varphi)\sin(\varphi + \tfrac{\pi}{2})

$$



Where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the initial velocities of the objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are their masses, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are their movement angles, and $\varphi$ is the contact angle. These equations can be derived from the fact that the interaction between the two bodies is easily calculated along the contact angle. By rotating the x and y axis to be parallel with the contact angle, the velocities of the objects can be calculated in one dimension and then rotated back to the original orientation to get the true x and y components of the velocities.



In an angle-free representation, the changed velocities are computed using the centers and at the time of contact as:



$$

\mathbf{v}'_1 = \mathbf{v}_1-\frac{2 m_2}{m_1+m_2} \ \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}_1-\mathbf{v}_2,\,\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2\rangle}{\|\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2\|^2} \ (\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2)

\\

\mathbf{v}'_2 = \mathbf{v}_2-\frac{2 m_1}{m_1+m_2} \ \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}_2-\mathbf{v}_1,\,\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1\rangle}{\|\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1\|^2} \ (\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1)

$$



Where the angle brackets indicate the inner product (or dot product) of two vectors.



It is important to note that these equations assume a perfectly elastic collision, where no kinetic energy is lost. In reality, there will always be some energy loss due to factors such as friction and deformation of the objects involved.



In the context of impulse response, collisions play a significant role in determining the behavior of a system. When an impulse input is applied to a system, it can be seen as a sudden collision with a high-intensity force. By analyzing the impulse response of the system, we can understand how it will react to such a disturbance and design controllers to regulate its response.



In the next section, we will explore the properties of impulse response and its relationship to the transfer function, providing a deeper understanding of this fundamental tool in the analysis and design of dynamic systems.

$$

$$



Where the angle brackets indicate the inner product (or dot product) of two vectors. These equations show that the final velocities of the objects depend on their initial velocities, masses, and the contact angle between them.



#### Subsection 2.1b: Physics of Collisions



To better understand the equations for calculating final velocities in a collision, it is important to understand the physics behind collisions. In a collision, two objects come into contact with each other and exert forces on each other. These forces can cause changes in the objects' velocities and directions of motion.



One important concept in collisions is the conservation of momentum. In an isolated system, the total momentum before a collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This means that the sum of the objects' masses multiplied by their velocities in the x and y directions will be the same before and after the collision.



Another important concept is the conservation of kinetic energy. In an elastic collision, the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved. This means that the sum of the objects' masses multiplied by their velocities squared will be the same before and after the collision.



Using these principles, we can derive the equations for calculating final velocities in a collision. By considering the forces and momentum involved, we can determine the changes in velocities and directions of motion for each object.



In conclusion, understanding the physics of collisions is crucial for modeling and controlling dynamic systems. By considering the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy, we can derive equations for calculating final velocities in a collision. These equations can then be used to accurately model and control dynamic systems.

Where $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ are the initial velocities of the objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are their masses, and $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$ are their positions at the time of contact. This equation can be derived from the conservation of momentum and the fact that the change in velocity is in the direction of the line connecting the centers of the objects at the time of contact.



#### Subsection 2.1b: Types of Collisions



As mentioned earlier, collisions can be classified into two types: elastic and inelastic. In an elastic collision, the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved, while in an inelastic collision, some of the kinetic energy is lost. In real-world scenarios, most collisions are inelastic due to factors such as friction and deformation of the objects involved. However, in the context of impulse response, we will focus on elastic collisions as they provide a simpler and more idealized scenario for analysis.



#### Subsection 2.1c: Applications of Collisions



Collisions have many applications in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and sports. In physics, collisions are used to study the conservation of momentum and energy. In engineering, collisions are important in designing safety features for vehicles and structures. In sports, collisions are a crucial aspect of gameplay, such as in billiards and pool.



In the context of impulse response, collisions are important in understanding the behavior of dynamic systems and designing control strategies. By modeling collisions and their effects on the system, we can predict and control the response of the system to external forces. This is particularly useful in fields such as robotics and aerospace engineering, where precise control of dynamic systems is crucial.



In the next section, we will explore the concept of impulse response in more detail and see how it relates to collisions in dynamic systems.

## Chapter 2: Impulse Response



### Section 2.2: Conservation of Momentum



In the previous section, we explored the concept of collisions and their implications in the context of impulse response. In this section, we will delve deeper into the underlying principle behind collisions - conservation of momentum.



#### Subsection 2.2a: Understanding Conservation of Momentum



Conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant over time, unless acted upon by an external force. This principle can be mathematically expressed as:



$$

\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \vec F

$$



where $\vec p$ is the momentum of the system and $\vec F$ is the resulting force acting on the system. This equation is known as the Cauchy momentum equation and is derived from the generalized momentum conservation principle.



To better understand this principle, let us analyze each side of the equation. On the right side, we have the resulting force acting on the system, which can be further split into body forces and surface forces. Body forces act on the entire system, while surface forces act on the walls of the system. By adding the "X" components of these forces, we can calculate the total surface force acting on the system.



On the left side, we have the change in momentum of the system over time. This change is proportional to the resulting force acting on the system, as stated by the conservation of momentum principle.



By understanding the conservation of momentum, we can better predict the behavior of dynamic systems and accurately model their impulse response. In the next section, we will explore the concept of impulse response in more detail.

By understanding the conservation of momentum, we can better predict the behavior of dynamic systems and accurately model their impulse response. In the next section, we will explore the concept of impulse response in more detail.



#### Subsection 2.2b: Applications of Conservation of Momentum



The conservation of momentum principle has numerous applications in the field of dynamics and control. One such application is in the study of moving loads, which can be analyzed using the Yakushev approach.



The Yakushev approach involves using the Cauchy momentum equation to model the dynamics of a moving load. By considering the change in momentum of the load over time, we can accurately predict its behavior and response to external forces.



Another application of the conservation of momentum principle is in the comparison of the left and right sides of the Cauchy momentum equation. By comparing the resulting force on the system to the change in momentum, we can gain a better understanding of the forces at play and their effects on the system.

### Section 2.2: Conservation of Momentum



In the previous section, we explored the concept of collisions and their implications in the context of impulse response. In this section, we will delve deeper into the underlying principle behind collisions - conservation of momentum.



#### Subsection 2.2a: Understanding Conservation of Momentum



Conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant over time, unless acted upon by an external force. This principle can be mathematically expressed as:



$$

\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \vec F

$$



where $\vec p$ is the momentum of the system and $\vec F$ is the resulting force acting on the system. This equation is known as the Cauchy momentum equation and is derived from the generalized momentum conservation principle.



To better understand this principle, let us analyze each side of the equation. On the right side, we have the resulting force acting on the system, which can be further split into body forces and surface forces. Body forces act on the entire system, while surface forces act on the walls of the system. By adding the "X" components of these forces, we can calculate the total surface force acting on the system.



On the left side, we have the change in momentum of the system over time. This change is proportional to the resulting force acting on the system, as stated by the conservation of momentum principle.



By understanding the conservation of momentum, we can better predict the behavior of dynamic systems and accurately model their impulse response. In the next section, we will explore the concept of impulse response in more detail.

#### Subsection 2.2c: Challenges in Conservation of Momentum



While the conservation of momentum principle is a powerful tool in the study of dynamics and control, there are some challenges that must be considered. One challenge is the accurate measurement of forces and momentum in real-world systems. In many cases, there may be external forces acting on a system that are difficult to measure or account for, leading to errors in the conservation of momentum equation.



Another challenge is the assumption of a closed system. In reality, most systems are not completely closed and may experience external forces that cannot be accounted for. This can lead to discrepancies in the conservation of momentum equation and affect the accuracy of our predictions.



Despite these challenges, the conservation of momentum remains a fundamental principle in the study of dynamics and control, providing valuable insights into the behavior of dynamic systems. In the next section, we will explore the concept of impulse response in more detail and see how it relates to the conservation of momentum.

To overcome this challenge, hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) are used. These equations break down the complex system into smaller subsystems, making it easier to analyze and control the motion of each individual body.

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of plane-motion kinematics for rigid bodies and explored some of its applications in various fields. Now, we will delve into the next step of understanding the behavior of rigid bodies in motion - plane-motion dynamics.



#### Introduction to Plane-motion Dynamics



Plane-motion dynamics deals with the study of forces and torques acting on a rigid body in motion. It is a crucial aspect of understanding the behavior of physical systems and is used extensively in fields such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and mechanical engineering.



The fundamental principle of plane-motion dynamics is Newton's Second Law, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration. In the case of a rigid body, this law can be extended to include rotational motion as well, where the net torque acting on the body is equal to its moment of inertia multiplied by its angular acceleration.



#### Equations of Motion for Rigid Bodies



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body, we need to derive the equations of motion that govern its motion. These equations are derived using the principles of Newton's Second Law and are dependent on the type of motion being considered - translational or rotational.



For translational motion, the equation of motion is given by:



$$

\sum F = ma

$$



where $\sum F$ is the sum of all external forces acting on the body, $m$ is the mass of the body, and $a$ is its acceleration.



For rotational motion, the equation of motion is given by:



$$

\sum \tau = I\alpha

$$



where $\sum \tau$ is the sum of all external torques acting on the body, $I$ is the moment of inertia of the body, and $\alpha$ is its angular acceleration.



#### Solving Plane-motion Dynamics Problems



Solving plane-motion dynamics problems involves applying the derived equations of motion to a specific system and solving for the unknown variables. This process can be challenging, especially for complex systems with multiple interconnected rigid bodies.



To simplify the process, various techniques such as the Lagrangian method and the Newton-Euler method are used. These methods allow for a systematic approach to solving dynamics problems and are widely used in the field of engineering.

# Title: Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 3: Plane-motion Kinematics:



### Section: 3.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 3.3c Challenges in Plane-motion Dynamics



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of plane-motion dynamics for rigid bodies and derived the equations of motion for both translational and rotational motion. However, as with any mathematical model, there are certain challenges that arise when applying these equations to real-world systems. In this subsection, we will explore some of these challenges and how they can be addressed.



#### Non-ideal Conditions



One of the main challenges in applying plane-motion dynamics is dealing with non-ideal conditions. In an ideal scenario, the equations of motion would accurately predict the behavior of a rigid body. However, in reality, there are factors such as friction, air resistance, and imperfections in the system that can affect the motion of a body.



For example, in the case of a robotic arm, friction in the joints can cause the arm to move differently than predicted by the equations of motion. In order to account for these non-ideal conditions, engineers must carefully calibrate and adjust the system to minimize their effects.



#### Complex Systems



Another challenge in plane-motion dynamics arises when dealing with complex systems. In real-world applications, rigid bodies are often part of larger, interconnected systems. This can make it difficult to isolate and analyze the dynamics of a single body.



For instance, in the case of an aircraft, the motion of the wings is affected by the motion of the entire aircraft, as well as external factors such as wind and air resistance. In order to accurately model and control the motion of the wings, engineers must consider the dynamics of the entire system.



#### Computational Complexity



The equations of motion for plane-motion dynamics can become quite complex, especially when dealing with multiple bodies and non-ideal conditions. This can make it challenging to solve these equations and obtain accurate results.



To address this challenge, various numerical methods and computer simulations have been developed to solve the equations of motion. These methods allow for more efficient and accurate analysis of complex systems, but they also require a strong understanding of the underlying principles of plane-motion dynamics.



#### Limitations of the Model



Finally, it is important to recognize that the equations of motion for plane-motion dynamics are based on certain assumptions and simplifications. While these equations can provide valuable insights and predictions, they may not always accurately reflect the behavior of a real-world system.



For example, the equations of motion assume that rigid bodies are perfectly rigid and do not deform under external forces. In reality, all bodies have some degree of flexibility and can deform under stress. This can lead to discrepancies between the predicted and actual motion of a body.



In conclusion, while the equations of motion for plane-motion dynamics provide a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of rigid bodies, there are certain challenges that must be considered and addressed in order to apply them effectively in real-world applications. By understanding these challenges and utilizing appropriate methods and techniques, engineers can overcome these limitations and continue to advance our understanding of dynamics and control.

### Section: 4.1 Uniaxial Motion:



In this section, we will briefly review the concept of uniaxial motion, which is a fundamental topic covered in 2.003. Uniaxial motion refers to the motion of a body or object along a single axis, which can be either translational or rotational. This type of motion is commonly seen in many engineering systems, such as vehicles, robots, and machines.



#### 4.1a Understanding Uniaxial Motion



To understand uniaxial motion, we must first understand the concept of degrees of freedom (DOF). DOF refers to the number of independent parameters that define the motion of a system. In uniaxial motion, there is only one DOF, as the motion is constrained to a single axis. This means that the motion of the system can be fully described by a single parameter, such as position or angle.



In the case of translational uniaxial motion, the system moves along a single axis in a straight line. This can be described by the position of the object along the axis, which can be represented by a single variable, such as x. The motion of the object can then be described by the change in position over time, or velocity, which is denoted by dx/dt.



On the other hand, rotational uniaxial motion refers to the rotation of an object around a single axis. This can be described by the angle of rotation, which is denoted by θ. The motion of the object can then be described by the change in angle over time, or angular velocity, which is denoted by dθ/dt.



In 2.003, students learn how to model and analyze uniaxial motion using differential equations, Laplace transforms, and transfer functions. These tools allow engineers to predict the behavior of a system and design control strategies to achieve desired performance. For example, in the case of a vehicle, understanding the uniaxial motion of the wheels is crucial for designing a control system that can steer and stabilize the vehicle.



In addition to translational and rotational uniaxial motion, 2.003 also covers other types of uniaxial motion, such as harmonic motion and damped motion. These concepts are essential for understanding the behavior of dynamic systems and designing control strategies to achieve desired performance.



In conclusion, uniaxial motion is a fundamental concept in 2.003 that is crucial for understanding the behavior of dynamic systems. By understanding the concept of DOF and using mathematical tools, engineers can model and analyze uniaxial motion to design control strategies for a wide range of engineering systems.

## Chapter 5: Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies



### Section: 5.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies



In the previous section, we reviewed the fundamentals of dynamics and control covered in 2.003. Now, we will delve into the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion. This section will focus on the kinematics of rigid bodies, which is the study of the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion.



#### 5.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



Before we dive into the specifics of plane-motion kinematics, let's first define what we mean by "plane motion." In this context, plane motion refers to the motion of a rigid body in a two-dimensional plane. This means that the body is constrained to move in a single plane and all points on the body move in parallel planes.



Now, let's discuss the key concepts of plane-motion kinematics. The first concept is the position of a rigid body, which is defined by the location of its center of mass. The position of the center of mass can be described using Cartesian coordinates or polar coordinates.



Next, we have the velocity of a rigid body, which is the rate of change of its position. This can also be described using Cartesian or polar coordinates. The acceleration of a rigid body is the rate of change of its velocity and can also be described using either coordinate system.



To fully understand the motion of a rigid body, we must also consider its orientation. This is described by the rotation of the body around its center of mass. The orientation of a rigid body can be represented using different formalisms, such as axis-angle, Euler angles, or quaternions.



In addition to these concepts, we will also discuss the concept of rigid-body transformations, which are used to describe the motion of a rigid body in a plane. These transformations involve translating and rotating the body in the plane, and they are essential for understanding the dynamics of rigid bodies.



Now that we have a basic understanding of plane-motion kinematics, let's move on to the equations that govern the motion of rigid bodies in a plane. These equations are known as the Euler-Lagrange equations and they are derived from the principle of least action. They allow us to determine the motion of a rigid body given its initial conditions and the forces acting on it.



In the next section, we will explore the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion and how these equations are used to model and control their motion. But first, let's review the key concepts covered in this section.

### Section: 5.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies



In the previous section, we discussed the fundamentals of dynamics and control and how they relate to the study of rigid bodies in plane motion. Now, we will delve deeper into the kinematics of rigid bodies and explore their motion without considering the forces that cause it.



#### 5.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



Before we dive into the specifics of plane-motion kinematics, let's first define what we mean by "plane motion." In this context, plane motion refers to the motion of a rigid body in a two-dimensional plane. This means that the body is constrained to move in a single plane and all points on the body move in parallel planes.



Now, let's discuss the key concepts of plane-motion kinematics. The first concept is the position of a rigid body, which is defined by the location of its center of mass. The position of the center of mass can be described using Cartesian coordinates or polar coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates, the position of the center of mass is represented by the vector $\mathbf{r}$, while in polar coordinates, it is represented by the magnitude $r$ and the angle $\theta$.



Next, we have the velocity of a rigid body, which is the rate of change of its position. This can also be described using Cartesian or polar coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates, the velocity is represented by the vector $\mathbf{v}$, while in polar coordinates, it is represented by the magnitude $v$ and the angle $\dot{\theta}$.



The acceleration of a rigid body is the rate of change of its velocity and can also be described using either coordinate system. In Cartesian coordinates, the acceleration is represented by the vector $\mathbf{a}$, while in polar coordinates, it is represented by the magnitude $a$ and the angle $\ddot{\theta}$.



To fully understand the motion of a rigid body, we must also consider its orientation. This is described by the rotation of the body around its center of mass. The orientation of a rigid body can be represented using different formalisms, such as axis-angle, Euler angles, or quaternions. These representations allow us to describe the orientation of the body in a compact and efficient manner.



In addition to these concepts, we will also discuss the concept of rigid-body transformations, which are used to describe the motion of a rigid body in a plane. These transformations involve translating and rotating the body in the plane, and they are essential for understanding the dynamics of rigid bodies.



### Subsection: 5.2b Applications of Plane-motion Kinematics



Now that we have a solid understanding of the key concepts of plane-motion kinematics, let's explore some of its applications. One of the most common applications is in the field of factory automation infrastructure. Here, the kinematics of rigid bodies are used to design and control robotic arms and other automated systems.



Another application is in the visualization of the rotation of spacecraft in orbit. This is made possible by using Poinsot's construction, which involves the use of Poinsot's ellipsoid to represent the rotation of the spacecraft. This allows engineers and scientists to better understand and analyze the motion of spacecraft in orbit.



The concept of plane-motion kinematics is also used in the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), a popular state estimation algorithm used in control systems. The EKF uses continuous-time measurements to estimate the state of a system, making it a powerful tool for real-time applications.



In addition to these applications, the concept of plane-motion kinematics has also been generalized to the Continuous-time Extended Kalman Filter (CEKF). This version of the EKF takes into account the continuous-time nature of physical systems and is often used in applications where discrete-time measurements are taken.



#### Discrete-time measurements



While most physical systems are represented as continuous-time models, discrete-time measurements are often taken for state estimation using digital processors. In these cases, the system model and measurement model are given by:



$$

\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr)

$$



$$

\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)

$$



The EKF algorithm for discrete-time measurements involves initializing the state and covariance matrices, followed by a predict-update step that takes into account the system model, measurement model, and Kalman gain. Unlike the continuous-time EKF, the prediction and update steps are decoupled in the discrete-time version.



In conclusion, the study of plane-motion kinematics is essential for understanding the motion of rigid bodies in a two-dimensional plane. Its applications range from factory automation to spacecraft visualization and state estimation algorithms. By mastering the concepts and techniques of plane-motion kinematics, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics and control of rigid bodies in plane motion.

### Section: 5.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies



In the previous section, we discussed the fundamentals of dynamics and control and how they relate to the study of rigid bodies in plane motion. Now, we will delve deeper into the kinematics of rigid bodies and explore their motion without considering the forces that cause it.



#### 5.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics

In this context, plane motion refers to the motion of a rigid body in a two-dimensional plane.

The position of the center of mass can be described using Cartesian coordinates or polar coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates, the position of the center of mass is represented by the vector $\mathbf{r}$, while in polar coordinates, it is represented by the magnitude $r$ and the angle $\theta$.



Next, we have the velocity of a rigid body, which is the rate of change of its position. This can also be described using Cartesian or polar coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates, the velocity is represented by the vector $\mathbf{v}$, while in polar coordinates, it is represented by the magnitude $v$ and the angle $\dot{\theta}$.

In Cartesian coordinates, the acceleration is represented by the vector $\mathbf{a}$, while in polar coordinates, it is represented by the magnitude $a$ and the angle $\ddot{\theta}$.



To fully understand the motion of a rigid body, we must also consider its orientation in space. This is described by the body's angular position, velocity, and acceleration. The angular position is represented by the angle $\theta$, the angular velocity is represented by $\dot{\theta}$, and the angular acceleration is represented by $\ddot{\theta}$. These values describe the rotation of the body about its center of mass.



Now that we have a basic understanding of the key concepts in plane-motion kinematics, let's explore some of the challenges that arise when studying the motion of rigid bodies in a two-dimensional plane.



#### 5.2b Challenges in Plane-motion Kinematics



One of the main challenges in studying plane-motion kinematics is dealing with the complexity of the motion itself. Unlike the simple linear motion of a point mass, the motion of a rigid body involves both translation and rotation. This adds an extra layer of complexity to the equations and requires a deeper understanding of kinematics.



Another challenge is accurately representing the motion of a rigid body in a two-dimensional plane. While we can simplify the motion by assuming that all points on the body move in parallel planes, this is not always the case in real-world scenarios. In some cases, the motion of a rigid body may involve non-parallel planes, making it more difficult to accurately model and analyze.



Additionally, the motion of a rigid body can be affected by external forces and torques, which can complicate the kinematic equations. These forces and torques can cause the body to deviate from its ideal motion and require more advanced techniques to accurately model and analyze.



Despite these challenges, understanding the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion is crucial for studying their dynamics and control. By accurately representing the motion of a rigid body, we can better understand its behavior and make informed decisions when designing control systems for these systems.



In the next section, we will explore the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion and how they are affected by external forces and torques.

### Section: 5.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies



In the previous section, we discussed the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion, focusing on the position, velocity, and acceleration of the center of mass. Now, we will build upon this knowledge and introduce the concept of dynamics, which takes into account the forces that cause the motion of a rigid body.



#### 5.3a Understanding Plane-motion Dynamics



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we must first define the forces that act upon it. These forces can be divided into two categories: external forces and internal forces. External forces are those that act on the body from outside, such as gravity, friction, and applied forces. Internal forces, on the other hand, are forces that act between different parts of the body, such as tension, compression, and shear.



The motion of a rigid body is governed by Newton's laws of motion, which state that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration. In the case of a rigid body, this can be expressed as:



$$

\sum \mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}

$$



where $\sum \mathbf{F}$ represents the sum of all external forces acting on the body, $m$ is the mass of the body, and $\mathbf{a}$ is the acceleration of the center of mass.



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body, we must also consider its rotational motion. This is described by the moment of inertia, which is a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion. The moment of inertia is dependent on the mass distribution of the body and can be calculated using the following equation:



$$

I = \int r^2 dm

$$



where $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation and $dm$ is an infinitesimal mass element.



In addition to external forces, the motion of a rigid body is also affected by internal forces, which can cause changes in the body's shape and orientation. These internal forces can be described using the concept of stress and strain, which measure the internal forces and deformations within a body, respectively.



In summary, understanding the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion requires an understanding of external and internal forces, Newton's laws of motion, and the concepts of moment of inertia, stress, and strain. In the following sections, we will explore these concepts in more detail and apply them to various examples of rigid body motion.

### Section: 5.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies



In the previous section, we discussed the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion, focusing on the position, velocity, and acceleration of the center of mass. Now, we will build upon this knowledge and introduce the concept of dynamics, which takes into account the forces that cause the motion of a rigid body.



#### 5.3a Understanding Plane-motion Dynamics



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we must first define the forces that act upon it. These forces can be divided into two categories: external forces and internal forces. External forces are those that act on the body from outside, such as gravity, friction, and applied forces. Internal forces, on the other hand, are forces that act between different parts of the body, such as tension, compression, and shear.



The motion of a rigid body is governed by Newton's laws of motion, which state that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration. In the case of a rigid body, this can be expressed as:



$$

\sum \mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}

$$



where $\sum \mathbf{F}$ represents the sum of all external forces acting on the body, $m$ is the mass of the body, and $\mathbf{a}$ is the acceleration of the center of mass.



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body, we must also consider its rotational motion. This is described by the moment of inertia, which is a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion. The moment of inertia is dependent on the mass distribution of the body and can be calculated using the following equation:



$$

I = \int r^2 dm

$$



where $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation and $dm$ is an infinitesimal mass element.



In addition to external forces, the motion of a rigid body is also affected by internal forces, which can cause changes in the body's shape and orientation. These internal forces can be further classified as either conservative or non-conservative forces.



Conservative forces are those that do not dissipate energy and can be described by a potential energy function. Examples of conservative forces include gravity and elastic forces. On the other hand, non-conservative forces, such as friction and air resistance, dissipate energy and cannot be described by a potential energy function.



The dynamics of a rigid body can be described using the equations of motion, which take into account both the translational and rotational motion of the body. These equations can be derived using Newton's laws of motion and the moment of inertia, and can be written as:



$$

\sum \mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}

$$



$$

\sum \mathbf{M} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha}

$$



where $\sum \mathbf{F}$ and $\sum \mathbf{M}$ represent the sum of all external forces and moments acting on the body, respectively, $m$ is the mass of the body, $I$ is the moment of inertia, $\mathbf{a}$ is the acceleration of the center of mass, and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ is the angular acceleration.



Understanding the dynamics of a rigid body is crucial in many engineering applications, such as designing and controlling vehicles, robots, and other mechanical systems. In the next section, we will explore some applications of plane-motion dynamics in these fields.

### Section: 5.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies



In the previous section, we discussed the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion, focusing on the position, velocity, and acceleration of the center of mass. Now, we will build upon this knowledge and introduce the concept of dynamics, which takes into account the forces that cause the motion of a rigid body.



#### 5.3a Understanding Plane-motion Dynamics



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we must first define the forces that act upon it. These forces can be divided into two categories: external forces and internal forces. External forces are those that act on the body from outside, such as gravity, friction, and applied forces.

To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body, we must also consider its rotational motion. This is described by the moment of inertia, which is a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion. The moment of inertia is dependent on the mass distribution of the body and can be calculated using the following equation:



$$

$$



where $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation and $dm$ is an infinitesimal mass element.



In addition to external forces, the motion of a rigid body is also affected by internal forces, which can cause changes in the body's shape and orientation. These internal forces can be further divided into two types: conservative and non-conservative. Conservative forces, such as tension and compression, do not dissipate energy and can be described by a potential energy function. Non-conservative forces, such as friction and air resistance, dissipate energy and cannot be described by a potential energy function.



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body, we must also consider the concept of work and energy. Work is defined as the product of a force and the displacement in the direction of that force. The work done by a force can be calculated using the following equation:



$$

W = \int \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s}

$$



where $\mathbf{F}$ is the force and $d\mathbf{s}$ is the displacement. The work-energy theorem states that the work done by all forces acting on a body is equal to the change in the body's kinetic energy. This can be expressed as:



$$

W = \Delta K

$$



where $W$ is the work done and $\Delta K$ is the change in kinetic energy.



In the next section, we will explore the equations of motion for a rigid body in plane motion, taking into account both translational and rotational dynamics. We will also discuss the concept of equilibrium and how it relates to the motion of a rigid body.

As mentioned in the previous section, kinetic width is a measure of the extent of a moving set of points. In the context of rigid bodies, this means the maximum distance between any two points in the body at any given time. This concept is crucial in analyzing the motion of rigid bodies and can be used to optimize the layout of machines and equipment in factory automation infrastructure.



Another important concept in understanding plane-motion dynamics is kinematic chains. A kinematic chain is a series of rigid bodies connected by joints that allow for relative motion between them. By analyzing the kinematic chain, we can determine the degrees of freedom of the system and design controllers to regulate its motion.



In three-dimensional space, there are multiple ways to represent the rotation of a rigid body. These are known as rotation formalisms. Some common rotation formalisms include Euler angles, rotation matrices, and quaternions. Each of these formalisms has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific application.



#### Continuous-time Extended Kalman Filter



In the previous chapter, we discussed the discrete-time extended Kalman filter, which is commonly used for state estimation in physical systems. However, most physical systems are represented as continuous-time models, while measurements are taken at discrete intervals. In such cases, the continuous-time extended Kalman filter is used.



The continuous-time extended Kalman filter follows a similar prediction-update process as the discrete-time version. However, the prediction and update steps are coupled in the continuous-time version. This filter also takes into account the noise in both the system model and the measurements.



#### Discrete-time Measurements



In many cases, physical systems are represented as continuous-time models, but measurements are taken at discrete intervals. In such cases, the system model and measurement model are given by differential equations, and the measurements are taken at discrete intervals. This requires the use of a discrete-time extended Kalman filter, which is similar to the continuous-time version but takes into account the discrete measurements.



In conclusion, understanding the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion is crucial in designing controllers for complex systems. The concepts of kinetic width, kinematic chains, and rotation formalisms are essential in analyzing and optimizing the motion of these systems. Additionally, the use of extended Kalman filters is necessary for accurate state estimation in physical systems.

In the previous section, we discussed the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion. Now, we will delve into the dynamics of these systems. Dynamics is the study of motion considering the forces that cause it. In the case of rigid bodies, these forces can cause both translation and rotation.



#### Understanding Plane-motion Dynamics



To understand the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion, we must first define the concept of kinetic width. As mentioned in the previous section, kinetic width is a measure of the extent of a moving set of points. In the context of rigid bodies, this means the maximum distance between any two points in the body at any given time.

In the previous chapter, we discussed the discrete-time extended Kalman filter, which is commonly used for state estimation in physical systems. However, most physical systems are represented as continuous-time models, while measurements are taken at discrete intervals. This discrepancy can lead to errors in state estimation. To address this issue, we introduce the continuous-time extended Kalman filter.



The continuous-time extended Kalman filter is a state estimation algorithm that takes into account the continuous-time dynamics of a system and the discrete-time measurements. It is an extension of the discrete-time extended Kalman filter and is commonly used in applications such as navigation, robotics, and aerospace engineering.



The model for the continuous-time extended Kalman filter is similar to that of the discrete-time extended Kalman filter, with the addition of a process noise term. The process noise term accounts for the uncertainty in the continuous-time dynamics of the system. The measurement model remains the same as in the discrete-time case.



The continuous-time extended Kalman filter also has a predict-update step, but unlike the discrete-time case, these steps are coupled. This means that the prediction step takes into account the measurements from the update step, resulting in a more accurate estimation of the state.



#### Discrete-time Measurements



In most cases, physical systems are modeled as continuous-time systems, but measurements are taken at discrete intervals. This discrepancy can lead to errors in state estimation. To address this issue, we can use the discrete-time extended Kalman filter with the continuous-time model. This approach is known as the discrete-time measurements extended Kalman filter.



The discrete-time measurements extended Kalman filter is similar to the continuous-time extended Kalman filter, but the measurement model is modified to account for the discrete-time measurements. This approach is commonly used in applications where the measurements are taken at discrete intervals, such as in digital control systems.



In conclusion, the continuous-time extended Kalman filter and the discrete-time measurements extended Kalman filter are powerful tools for state estimation in physical systems. By taking into account the continuous-time dynamics and the discrete-time measurements, these filters provide more accurate estimations of the state, making them essential in various engineering applications.

### Section: 7.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of modeling dynamics and control for linear systems. In this section, we will build upon that foundation and apply it to systems with rigid bodies. Rigid bodies are objects that maintain their shape and size even when subjected to external forces. Examples of rigid bodies include cars, airplanes, and robots.



In this section, we will focus on the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion. Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. We will begin by defining some key terms and concepts related to plane-motion kinematics.



#### 7.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



Before we dive into the specifics of plane-motion kinematics, let's review some important concepts from 2.003 that will be relevant to this section.



Firstly, we will be using state-space equations to model the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion. These equations describe the behavior of a system in terms of its state variables, inputs, and outputs. In the case of rigid bodies, the state variables will represent the position, orientation, and velocity of the body.



Secondly, we will be utilizing feedback control to achieve desired performance and stability in our system. Feedback control is a crucial aspect of control systems, as it allows the controller to adjust its inputs based on information about the current state of the system.



Now, let's move on to discussing the specifics of plane-motion kinematics. In plane motion, a rigid body can move in two dimensions, and its motion can be described using translational and rotational motion. Translational motion refers to the movement of the body's center of mass, while rotational motion refers to the rotation of the body about its center of mass.



To fully describe the motion of a rigid body in plane motion, we need to define its position, orientation, and velocity.

Translational motion refers to the movement of the body's center of mass, while rotational motion refers to the rotation of the body about its center of mass.



To fully describe the motion of a rigid body in plane motion, we need to consider both translational and rotational motion. This can be done using a combination of linear and angular velocity vectors. The linear velocity vector represents the velocity of the body's center of mass, while the angular velocity vector represents the rate of change of the body's orientation.



In order to control the motion of a rigid body, we need to understand how these velocity vectors change over time. This is where the concept of kinematic equations comes in. Kinematic equations describe the relationship between the position, velocity, and acceleration of a body in motion. In the case of rigid bodies, these equations can be derived using the principles of rigid body dynamics.



#### 7.2b Applications of Plane-motion Kinematics



The study of plane-motion kinematics has many practical applications, particularly in the field of robotics and automation. One of the key applications is in the design and control of robotic arms and manipulators. By understanding the kinematics of rigid bodies, engineers can design robots that can perform precise and complex tasks with high accuracy.



Another important application is in the control of spacecraft in orbit. By using kinematic equations and feedback control, engineers can accurately control the orientation and position of spacecraft, allowing them to perform various tasks such as docking, maneuvering, and data collection.



In addition, the principles of plane-motion kinematics are also used in the design and control of vehicles, such as cars and airplanes. By understanding the relationship between translational and rotational motion, engineers can design vehicles that are stable, efficient, and safe to operate.

For example, the concept of kinematic equations can be applied to non-rigid bodies and systems with more than two dimensions of motion.



### Continuous-time extended Kalman filter



In this section, we will introduce the continuous-time extended Kalman filter (EKF), which is a widely used method for state estimation in control systems. The EKF is an extension of the discrete-time extended Kalman filter, which was discussed in the previous chapter.



#### Model



The EKF is used to estimate the state of a system based on noisy measurements. It assumes that the system can be described by a set of differential equations, known as the state-space model. The model is given by:



$$

\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr)

$$



$$

\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)

$$



where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector, $\mathbf{u}(t)$ is the input vector, $\mathbf{w}(t)$ is the process noise, $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement vector, and $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise. The process noise and measurement noise are assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrices $\mathbf{Q}(t)$ and $\mathbf{R}(t)$, respectively.



#### Initialize



The EKF begins by initializing the state estimate and covariance matrix at time $t_0$:



$$

\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t_0) = E\bigl[\mathbf{x}(t_0)\bigr] \quad \mathbf{P}(t_0) = Var\bigl[\mathbf{x}(t_0)\bigr]

$$



#### Predict-Update



The EKF then performs a predict-update cycle to estimate the state at each time step. The predict step uses the state-space model to predict the state at time $t$:



$$

\dot{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}(t) = f\bigl(\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)\bigr)+\mathbf{K}(t)\Bigl(\mathbf{z}(t)-h\bigl(\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)\bigr)\Bigr)

$$



$$

\dot{\mathbf{P}}(t) = \mathbf{F}(t)\mathbf{P}(t)+\mathbf{P}(t)\mathbf{F}(t)^{T}-\mathbf{K}(t)\mathbf{H}(t)\mathbf{P}(t)+\mathbf{Q}(t)

$$



where $\mathbf{K}(t)$ is the Kalman gain, $\mathbf{F}(t)$ is the state transition matrix, and $\mathbf{H}(t)$ is the measurement sensitivity matrix. These matrices are calculated as follows:



$$

\mathbf{K}(t) = \mathbf{P}(t)\mathbf{H}(t)^{T}\mathbf{R}(t)^{-1}

$$



$$

\mathbf{F}(t) = \left . \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{x} } \right \vert _{\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)}

$$



$$

\mathbf{H}(t) = \left . \frac{\partial h}{\partial \mathbf{x} } \right \vert _{\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)}

$$



The update step then uses the measurement to correct the state estimate and covariance matrix:



$$

\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \hat{\mathbf{x}}(t) + \mathbf{K}(t)\Bigl(\mathbf{z}(t)-h\bigl(\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)\bigr)\Bigr)

$$



$$

\mathbf{P}(t) = \mathbf{P}(t) - \mathbf{K}(t)\mathbf{H}(t)\mathbf{P}(t)

$$



#### Discrete-time measurements



In most cases, measurements are taken at discrete time intervals, while the system is modeled using continuous-time equations. In this case, the measurement model can be modified to account for the discrete-time measurements:



$$

\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)

$$



where $\mathbf{z}(t)$ is the measurement vector at time $t$, and $\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the measurement noise, assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrix $\mathbf{R}(t)$.



#### Conclusion



The continuous-time extended Kalman filter is a powerful tool for state estimation in control systems. By utilizing the state-space model and feedback control, it can accurately estimate the state of a system even in the presence of noise. Its applications are widespread, from robotics and automation to spacecraft control and vehicle design.

## Chapter 7: Control of Systems with Rigid Bodies



### Section: 7.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of modeling dynamics and control for linear systems. In this section, we will build upon that foundation and apply it to systems with rigid bodies. Rigid bodies are objects that maintain their shape and size even when subjected to external forces. Examples of rigid bodies include cars, airplanes, and robots.



In this section, we will focus on the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion. Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. We will begin by defining some key terms and concepts related to plane-motion kinematics.



#### 7.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



Before we dive into the specifics of plane-motion kinematics, let's review some important concepts from 2.003 that will be relevant to this section.



Firstly, we will be using state-space equations to model the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion. These equations describe the behavior of a system in terms of its state variables, inputs, and outputs. In the case of rigid bodies, the state variables will represent the position, orientation, and velocity of the body.



Secondly, we will be utilizing feedback control to achieve desired performance and stability in our system. Feedback control is a crucial aspect of control systems, as it allows the controller to adjust its inputs based on information about the current state of the system.



Now, let's move on to discussing the specifics of plane-motion kinematics. In plane motion, a rigid body can move in two dimensions, and its motion can be described using translational and rotational motion. Translational motion refers to the movement of the body's center of mass, while rotational motion refers to the rotation of the body about its center of mass.



To fully describe the motion of a rigid body in plane motion, we need to consider both translational and rotational motion. This can be done using a combination of linear and angular velocity vectors. The linear velocity vector represents the velocity of the body's center of mass, while the angular velocity vector represents the rate of change of the body's orientation.



In addition to velocity, we also need to consider the body's position and orientation in space. This can be done using a combination of linear and angular displacement vectors. The linear displacement vector represents the change in position of the body's center of mass, while the angular displacement vector represents the change in orientation of the body.



#### 7.2b Equations of Motion for Rigid Bodies in Plane Motion



To model the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we will use the state-space equations mentioned earlier. These equations can be written as:



$$

\dot{x} = Ax + Bu

$$



$$

y = Cx + Du

$$



Where:

- $x$ is the state vector, which includes the position, orientation, and velocity of the body

- $u$ is the input vector, which represents the forces and torques acting on the body

- $y$ is the output vector, which represents the position and orientation of the body

- $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are matrices that describe the dynamics of the system



To derive these equations, we will use the principles of Newtonian mechanics. We will consider the forces and torques acting on the body, as well as the body's mass and moments of inertia. By applying Newton's second law and the rotational equivalent, we can derive the equations of motion for a rigid body in plane motion.



#### 7.2c Challenges in Plane-motion Kinematics



While the equations of motion for rigid bodies in plane motion may seem straightforward, there are several challenges that arise when trying to control these systems. One of the main challenges is dealing with nonlinearity. Unlike linear systems, the dynamics of rigid bodies are highly nonlinear, making it difficult to design controllers that can accurately predict and control the behavior of the system.



Another challenge is dealing with the coupling between translational and rotational motion. In plane motion, these two types of motion are coupled, meaning that changes in one can affect the other. This makes it challenging to design controllers that can accurately control both types of motion simultaneously.



To overcome these challenges, advanced control techniques such as nonlinear control and adaptive control can be used. These techniques allow for more accurate modeling and control of nonlinear systems, making them well-suited for controlling rigid bodies in plane motion.



In the next section, we will explore some of these advanced control techniques and how they can be applied to control systems with rigid bodies.

In plane motion, a rigid body can move in two dimensions, and its motion can be described using translational and rotational motion. Translational motion refers to the movement of the body's center of mass, while rotational motion refers to the rotation of the body about its center of mass.



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we need to consider the forces and torques acting on the body. These forces and torques can come from external sources, such as applied forces or gravity, or from internal sources, such as friction or inertia. By analyzing these forces and torques, we can determine how they affect the motion of the body and design control strategies to achieve desired behavior.



In this section, we will also introduce the concept of moments of inertia, which play a crucial role in the dynamics of rigid bodies. Moments of inertia represent the resistance of a body to rotational motion and are dependent on the body's mass distribution and geometry. By understanding moments of inertia, we can better predict and control the rotational motion of a rigid body.



In summary, this section will cover the fundamentals of plane-motion dynamics for rigid bodies, including the use of state-space equations, feedback control, and moments of inertia. By the end of this section, readers will have a solid understanding of how forces and torques affect the motion of rigid bodies in plane motion and how to design control strategies to achieve desired behavior.

To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we need to consider the forces and torques acting on the body. These forces and torques can come from external sources, such as applied forces or gravity, or from internal sources, such as friction or internal stresses. In order to accurately model the dynamics of a rigid body, we must take into account all of these forces and torques.



One way to represent the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion is through the use of Newton's laws of motion. These laws state that the net force acting on a body is equal to its mass times its acceleration, and the net torque acting on a body is equal to its moment of inertia times its angular acceleration. By applying these laws to a rigid body in plane motion, we can derive the equations of motion that describe the behavior of the body.



Another important concept in plane-motion dynamics is the concept of equilibrium. A rigid body is said to be in equilibrium when the net force and net torque acting on it are both equal to zero. In other words, the body is not accelerating or rotating. Understanding equilibrium is crucial for designing control systems, as it allows us to determine the necessary inputs to achieve a desired state.



#### 7.3b Applications of Plane-motion Dynamics



The study of plane-motion dynamics has many practical applications. One example is in the design and control of spacecraft in orbit. By understanding the forces and torques acting on a spacecraft, we can accurately model its motion and design control systems to achieve desired trajectories and orientations.



Another application is in the design of vehicles, such as airplanes and cars. By analyzing the dynamics of these systems, we can optimize their performance and stability, leading to safer and more efficient transportation.



In addition, the principles of plane-motion dynamics are also used in the design of robots and other mechanical systems. By understanding the forces and torques acting on these systems, we can design control systems that allow them to perform complex tasks with precision and accuracy.



#### 7.3c Generalizations



The principles of plane-motion dynamics can also be applied to more complex systems, such as systems with flexible bodies or systems with multiple rigid bodies. In these cases, the equations of motion become more complex, but the same principles still apply.

This can make it difficult to analyze and control the system, especially in real-time applications.



Another challenge is dealing with the nonlinear nature of the equations. In many cases, the forces and torques acting on a rigid body are nonlinear functions of the state variables. This can make it difficult to find analytical solutions and may require the use of numerical methods for analysis and control.



Furthermore, the dynamics of a rigid body can be affected by external disturbances, such as wind or uneven terrain. These disturbances can make it challenging to accurately model and control the system, as they can introduce unpredictable variations in the forces and torques acting on the body.



Despite these challenges, there have been significant advancements in the field of plane-motion dynamics, particularly in the development of control strategies and numerical methods for analysis. These advancements have allowed for more accurate and efficient modeling and control of rigid bodies in plane motion.

## Chapter 8: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 8.1 Fixed-axis Rotation:



### Subsection: 8.1a Introduction to Fixed-axis Rotation



In the previous chapter, we explored the fundamentals of modeling dynamics and control in a uniaxial motion system. We learned about the different types of motion, such as translational and rotational, and how to model them using mathematical equations. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of uniaxial motion and explore more advanced concepts and techniques.



In this section, we will focus on fixed-axis rotation, which is a type of rotational motion where the axis of rotation remains fixed. This type of motion is commonly seen in objects such as spinning tops, gyroscopes, and wheels. Understanding fixed-axis rotation is crucial for designing control strategies for these types of systems.



To begin, let's review the basics of rotation formalisms in three dimensions. One common way to represent rotation is through an axis-angle representation, where the input axis <math>{a} = [{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math> is normalized. This representation is useful for visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit, as it allows us to easily calculate the rotation angle and axis.



Another important concept in fixed-axis rotation is Poinsot's construction, which is used to visualize the rotation of a rigid body. This construction involves drawing an ellipsoid, known as Poinsot's ellipsoid, which represents the rotation of the body. This ellipsoid can help us understand the orientation and angular velocity of the body at any given time.



Moving on to applications, one of the main uses of Poinsot's construction is in visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. By understanding the dynamics of the spacecraft and its rotation, we can design control strategies to maintain its desired orientation and trajectory.



Next, let's discuss the computation of the basis matrix for fixed-axis rotation. This matrix is built from rotating the vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) and reducing constants. Given an input <math>{Q}=[{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>, we can use this matrix to compute the resulting rotation matrix.



Alternatively, we can also use an alternate basis calculation method. This involves converting the input vector <math>{A} = [X, Y ,Z] </math> to an angle-axis representation, where the angle of rotation is <math> {\theta} = {\|A\|} </math> and the axis of rotation is <math>[x,y,z] = \frac {A} {\|A\|} </math>. This method can be useful in certain situations, such as when working with quaternions.



Now, let's discuss vector rotation in fixed-axis rotation. To rotate a vector <math>v = (X, Y, Z) </math> around the rotation vector <math> Q = (X,Y,Z) </math>, we can use the angle of rotation <math> {\theta} = {\|Q\|} </math> to calculate the resulting vector. This involves taking the cosine of the angle times the vector to rotate, plus the sine of the angle times the axis of rotation, plus one minus the cosine of the angle times the dot product of the vector and rotation axis times the axis of rotation.



In conclusion, fixed-axis rotation is an important concept in the study of uniaxial motion. By understanding the fundamentals of fixed-axis rotation, we can better model and control rotational systems in various applications. In the next section, we will explore the dynamics of fixed-axis rotation in more detail and discuss how external forces, such as friction, can affect the motion of a rotating body.





# Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 8: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 8.1 Fixed-axis Rotation:



### Subsection: 8.1b Applications of Fixed-axis Rotation



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of fixed-axis rotation and its importance in understanding the dynamics of rotational systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of fixed-axis rotation and how it is used in various fields.



One of the main applications of fixed-axis rotation is in visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. By using Poinsot's construction and the axis-angle representation, we can easily calculate the orientation and angular velocity of the spacecraft. This information is crucial for designing control strategies to maintain the desired trajectory and orientation of the spacecraft.



Another important application of fixed-axis rotation is in the field of computer graphics. The line integral convolution technique, which was first published in 1993, uses fixed-axis rotation to create realistic and visually appealing animations. This technique has been applied to a wide range of problems, such as fluid flow simulations and visualizing complex data sets.



In addition to these applications, fixed-axis rotation is also used in robotics and mechanical engineering. By understanding the dynamics of fixed-axis rotation, engineers can design more efficient and stable robotic systems. This is especially important in applications where precise control and stability are crucial, such as in industrial robots and prosthetic limbs.



Moving on to the computation of the basis matrix for fixed-axis rotation, there are two main methods that are commonly used. The first method involves rotating the vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) and reducing constants. This method is useful for calculating the basis matrix for a given input <math>{Q}=[{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>.



Alternatively, the basis matrix can also be computed using the angle-axis representation. This involves converting the input vector <math>{A} = [X, Y ,Z] </math> to an angle-axis representation, where <math> \theta = \|A\| </math> and <math>[x,y,z] = \frac {A} {\|A\|} </math>. This method is useful for calculating the basis matrix for a given angle and axis of rotation.



Lastly, let's discuss vector rotation in fixed-axis rotation. This involves rotating a vector <math>v = (X, Y, Z) </math> around the rotation vector <math> Q = (X,Y,Z) </math>. The angle of rotation is given by <math> {\theta} = {\|Q\|} </math>. By using the cosine and sine of the angle, as well as the dot product of the vector and rotation axis, we can easily calculate the resulting rotated vector.



In conclusion, fixed-axis rotation has a wide range of applications in various fields, including aerospace, computer graphics, and robotics. By understanding the fundamentals of fixed-axis rotation and its applications, we can design more efficient and stable systems in these fields. 





# Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 8: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 8.1 Fixed-axis Rotation:



### Subsection: 8.1c Challenges in Fixed-axis Rotation



In the previous sections, we have discussed the basics of fixed-axis rotation and its applications in various fields. However, like any other mathematical model, fixed-axis rotation also has its limitations and challenges. In this section, we will explore some of the challenges that arise when using fixed-axis rotation and how they can be addressed.



One of the main challenges in fixed-axis rotation is the assumption of a fixed rotation axis. In reality, most objects do not rotate around a single fixed axis, but rather have a combination of rotational and translational motion. This can lead to errors in the calculations and affect the accuracy of the model. To address this challenge, more complex models, such as the Euler angles and quaternion representations, can be used to better capture the motion of the object.



Another challenge in fixed-axis rotation is the issue of gimbal lock. Gimbal lock occurs when two of the three rotational axes align, causing the loss of one degree of freedom. This can lead to inaccuracies in the calculations and make it difficult to control the orientation of the object. To avoid gimbal lock, alternative representations, such as the quaternion representation, can be used.



Furthermore, the computation of the basis matrix for fixed-axis rotation can also be a challenge. As mentioned in the previous section, there are two main methods for computing the basis matrix. However, both methods have their limitations and may not be suitable for all situations. This requires careful consideration and selection of the appropriate method for a given problem.



In addition to these challenges, there are also limitations in the accuracy of fixed-axis rotation when dealing with large rotations. As the rotation angle increases, the errors in the calculations also increase, leading to a less accurate model. To address this, more advanced techniques, such as numerical integration methods, can be used to improve the accuracy of the model.



Despite these challenges, fixed-axis rotation remains a fundamental concept in understanding the dynamics of rotational systems. By understanding its limitations and addressing them appropriately, we can use fixed-axis rotation to effectively model and control various systems in engineering, robotics, and other fields.

### Section: 8.2 First and Second Order Systems:



### Subsection: 8.2a Understanding First Order Systems



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of first and second order systems and their applications in modeling dynamics and control. However, as with any mathematical model, there are limitations and challenges that arise when using these systems. In this section, we will explore some of these challenges and how they can be addressed.



One of the main challenges in using first and second order systems is the assumption of linearity. In reality, many systems exhibit nonlinear behavior, which cannot be accurately captured by these models. This can lead to errors in the predictions and control of the system. To address this challenge, more complex models, such as higher order systems or nonlinear models, can be used to better capture the behavior of the system.



Another challenge in using first and second order systems is the issue of initial conditions. These systems require initial conditions to be specified in order to solve for the system's response. However, in some cases, these initial conditions may not be known or may change over time. This can lead to inaccuracies in the predictions and control of the system. To address this challenge, techniques such as state estimation and adaptive control can be used to estimate and adjust for changing initial conditions.



Furthermore, the computation of the transfer function or state space representation for first and second order systems can also be a challenge. In some cases, the system may be too complex to be represented by a simple transfer function or state space model. This requires careful consideration and selection of the appropriate model for a given system.



In addition to these challenges, there are also limitations in the accuracy of first and second order systems when dealing with highly dynamic systems. As the system's dynamics become more complex, the errors in the predictions and control also increase. This can be addressed by using more advanced control techniques, such as adaptive control or model predictive control, to better handle the system's dynamics.



Overall, while first and second order systems are powerful tools for modeling dynamics and control, it is important to be aware of their limitations and challenges. By understanding these challenges and using more advanced techniques when necessary, we can create more accurate and robust models for a wide range of systems.

In addition to these challenges, there are also limitations in the accuracy of second order systems when dealing with highly dynamic systems. As the system's dynamics become more complex, the accuracy of the second order model decreases. This is due to the simplifications made in the model, such as neglecting higher order terms and assuming linear behavior. To address this, more advanced modeling techniques, such as system identification and adaptive control, can be used to better capture the dynamics of the system.

## Chapter 8: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 8.2 First and Second Order Systems:



### Subsection: 8.2c Comparing First and Second Order Systems



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of first and second order systems and their applications in modeling dynamics and control. We also explored some of the challenges that arise when using these systems, such as the assumption of linearity and the issue of initial conditions. In this section, we will delve deeper into these challenges and compare the strengths and limitations of first and second order systems.



First and second order systems are both commonly used in modeling dynamics and control, but they differ in their complexity and accuracy. First order systems, also known as single-input single-output (SISO) systems, have only one input and one output variable. They are relatively simple to model and analyze, making them a popular choice for introductory courses. However, they have limited accuracy and cannot capture the behavior of more complex systems.



On the other hand, second order systems, also known as multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, have multiple inputs and outputs and can capture more complex behavior. They are more accurate than first order systems, but they also require more complex mathematical models and computations. This can make them more challenging to analyze and control.



One of the main differences between first and second order systems is their ability to handle nonlinear behavior. First order systems are limited to linear behavior, while second order systems can handle nonlinear behavior to some extent. However, as mentioned in the previous section, second order systems still have limitations in accurately capturing nonlinear behavior. In these cases, more complex models, such as higher order systems or nonlinear models, may be necessary.



Another difference between first and second order systems is their sensitivity to initial conditions. First order systems are more sensitive to initial conditions, as they only have one state variable. This means that small changes in the initial conditions can have a significant impact on the system's response. In contrast, second order systems are less sensitive to initial conditions, as they have multiple state variables. This allows for more robust control and prediction of the system's behavior.



In terms of computation, first order systems are relatively simple to represent using transfer functions or state space models. However, second order systems can be more complex and may require more advanced techniques, such as partial fraction expansion or matrix operations, to obtain their transfer function or state space representation. This can make them more challenging to analyze and control.



In conclusion, first and second order systems have their own strengths and limitations, and the choice of which to use depends on the specific system being modeled and the desired level of accuracy. First order systems are simpler and more suitable for introductory courses, while second order systems are more complex but can capture more complex behavior. It is important to carefully consider the system's characteristics and requirements when selecting the appropriate model.

## Chapter 8: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 8.3 Natural and Forced Response:



### Subsection: 8.3a Understanding Natural Response



In the previous section, we discussed the natural and forced response of first and second order systems. We explored how these systems behave when subjected to external inputs and how they can be modeled and controlled. In this section, we will focus specifically on understanding the natural response of uniaxial motion systems.



The natural response of a system refers to its behavior without any external inputs or disturbances. It is solely determined by the system's initial conditions and its inherent dynamics. In the case of uniaxial motion, the natural response can be described by the system's position, velocity, and acceleration over time.



To better understand the natural response of uniaxial motion systems, let's consider the example of a simple mass-spring-damper system. This system consists of a mass attached to a spring and a damper, and it is commonly used to model mechanical systems. When the mass is displaced from its equilibrium position and released, it will oscillate back and forth due to the spring's restoring force and the damper's resistance.



The natural response of this system can be described by the equation of motion:



$$

m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = 0

$$



where $m$ is the mass, $c$ is the damping coefficient, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.



Solving this differential equation, we can obtain the position, velocity, and acceleration of the mass over time. The solution will depend on the initial conditions of the system, such as the initial displacement, velocity, and acceleration.



One important aspect of the natural response is the system's natural frequency, which is determined by the system's mass and stiffness. It represents the frequency at which the system will oscillate without any external inputs. In the case of the mass-spring-damper system, the natural frequency is given by:



$$

\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}

$$



Understanding the natural response of uniaxial motion systems is crucial in modeling and controlling these systems. It allows us to predict their behavior and design controllers that can effectively regulate their motion. In the next section, we will explore the forced response of uniaxial motion systems and how it differs from the natural response.





# Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 8: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 8.3 Natural and Forced Response:



### Subsection: 8.3b Understanding Forced Response



In the previous section, we discussed the natural response of uniaxial motion systems. We explored how these systems behave without any external inputs or disturbances, solely determined by their initial conditions and inherent dynamics. In this section, we will focus on understanding the forced response of uniaxial motion systems.



The forced response of a system refers to its behavior when subjected to external inputs or disturbances. It is influenced by both the system's inherent dynamics and the external inputs. In the case of uniaxial motion, the forced response can be described by the system's position, velocity, and acceleration over time, taking into account the effects of external inputs.



To better understand the forced response of uniaxial motion systems, let's continue with the example of the mass-spring-damper system. In this case, we will consider the system being subjected to an external force, such as a periodic input or a step input. The equation of motion for the system now becomes:



$$

m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F(t)

$$



where $F(t)$ represents the external force acting on the system.



Solving this differential equation, we can obtain the position, velocity, and acceleration of the mass over time, taking into account the effects of the external force. The solution will depend on both the initial conditions and the characteristics of the external force.



One important aspect of the forced response is the system's transfer function, which relates the input force to the system's output response. It is determined by the system's mass, stiffness, and damping, and it can be used to analyze and design control systems for uniaxial motion.



In summary, the forced response of uniaxial motion systems is influenced by both the system's inherent dynamics and external inputs. Understanding and analyzing the forced response is crucial for designing effective control systems for these systems. 





# Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 8: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 8.3 Natural and Forced Response:



### Subsection: 8.3c Comparing Natural and Forced Response



In the previous sections, we have discussed the natural and forced response of uniaxial motion systems. In this section, we will compare and contrast these two types of responses to gain a better understanding of their behavior.



The natural response of a system is solely determined by its initial conditions and inherent dynamics. It is a free response, meaning that it is not influenced by any external inputs or disturbances. On the other hand, the forced response is influenced by both the system's inherent dynamics and external inputs. It is a forced response, meaning that it is a direct result of the external inputs acting on the system.



One key difference between the natural and forced response is their time dependence. The natural response is a transient response, meaning that it decays over time and eventually reaches a steady-state. This is because the system's inherent dynamics cause it to return to its equilibrium state. On the other hand, the forced response is a steady-state response, meaning that it remains constant over time. This is because the external inputs continuously act on the system, preventing it from reaching a steady-state.



Another difference between the two responses is their dependence on initial conditions. The natural response is highly dependent on the initial conditions of the system, as they determine the system's behavior in the absence of external inputs. On the other hand, the forced response is less dependent on initial conditions and more influenced by the characteristics of the external inputs.



One important aspect to note is that the forced response can be controlled and manipulated through the choice of external inputs. This is where the concept of control systems comes into play. By designing and implementing control systems, we can influence the forced response of uniaxial motion systems to achieve desired behavior.



In summary, the natural and forced response of uniaxial motion systems have distinct characteristics and behaviors. While the natural response is a transient response determined by initial conditions and inherent dynamics, the forced response is a steady-state response influenced by external inputs. Understanding and analyzing these responses is crucial in the design and control of uniaxial motion systems.

## Chapter: Modeling Dynamics and Control II



### Introduction



In the previous chapter, we explored the concept of modeling dynamics and control using transfer functions. We learned how to represent a system's input-output behavior using a transfer function and how to analyze the system's stability and performance. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of modeling dynamics and control by focusing on impulse response.



Impulse response is a fundamental concept in the field of control systems. It is a mathematical representation of a system's response to an impulse input. An impulse input is a short burst of energy that has an infinitely small duration and an infinitely large amplitude. In real-world systems, an impulse input is not physically realizable, but it serves as a useful tool for understanding the behavior of a system.



The impulse response of a system is a time-domain representation of the system's behavior. It provides valuable insights into the system's characteristics, such as its stability, transient response, and steady-state response. By analyzing the impulse response, we can gain a better understanding of a system's behavior and make informed decisions about its design and control.



In this chapter, we will cover various topics related to impulse response, such as its definition, properties, and applications. We will also learn how to obtain the impulse response of a system using different methods, such as analytical, numerical, and experimental techniques. Furthermore, we will explore how to use the impulse response to analyze and design control systems.



Overall, this chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of impulse response and its significance in modeling dynamics and control. It will serve as a valuable resource for students and professionals in the field of control systems, helping them to develop a strong foundation in this important topic. 





## Chapter 9: Impulse Response:



### Section: 9.1 Collisions:



Collisions are a common occurrence in the physical world, and understanding their dynamics is crucial in many fields, including engineering, physics, and robotics. In this section, we will explore the concept of collisions and how they can be modeled using impulse response.



#### 9.1a Introduction to Collisions



A collision is an event in which two or more objects come into contact with each other and exchange energy and momentum. In the case of a two-dimensional collision with two moving objects, the final velocities of the objects can be calculated using the following equations:



$$

v'_{1x} = \frac{v_{1}\cos(\theta_1-\varphi)(m_1-m_2)+2m_2v_{2}\cos(\theta_2-\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}\cos(\varphi)+v_{1}\sin(\theta_1-\varphi)\cos(\varphi + \tfrac{\pi}{2})

\\[0.8em]

v'_{1y} = \frac{v_{1}\cos(\theta_1-\varphi)(m_1-m_2)+2m_2v_{2}\cos(\theta_2-\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}\sin(\varphi)+v_{1}\sin(\theta_1-\varphi)\sin(\varphi + \tfrac{\pi}{2}),

$$



where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the scalar sizes of the two original speeds of the objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are their masses, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are their movement angles. The lowercase phi ($\varphi$) represents the contact angle between the two objects.



These equations are derived from the fact that the interaction between the two bodies can be easily calculated along the contact angle. By rotating the x and y axes to be parallel with the contact angle, the velocities of the objects can be calculated in one dimension. They can then be rotated back to the original orientation to obtain the true x and y components of the velocities.



In an angle-free representation, the changed velocities are computed using the centers and at the time of contact as:



$$

\mathbf{v}'_1 = \mathbf{v}_1-\frac{2 m_2}{m_1+m_2} \ \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}_1-\mathbf{v}_2,\,\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2\rangle}{\|\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2\|^2} \ (\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2),

\\[0.8em]

\mathbf{v}'_2 = \mathbf{v}_2-\frac{2 m_1}{m_1+m_2} \ \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}_2-\mathbf{v}_1,\,\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1\rangle}{\|\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1\|^2} \ (\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1),

$$



where the angle brackets indicate the inner product (or dot product) of two vectors.



### Other conserved quantities



In addition to energy and momentum, there are other conserved quantities in collisions, such as angular momentum and kinetic energy. These quantities can also be used to analyze and model collisions using impulse response.



For example, the conservation of angular momentum states that the total angular momentum of a system remains constant in the absence of external torques. This can be used to analyze the rotational motion of objects in a collision and determine their final angular velocities.



Similarly, the conservation of kinetic energy states that the total kinetic energy of a system remains constant in an isolated system. This can be used to analyze the energy exchange between objects in a collision and determine their final velocities.



In conclusion, collisions are a complex phenomenon that can be modeled and analyzed using impulse response and other conserved quantities. By understanding the dynamics of collisions, we can design and control systems that can effectively handle these events. In the next section, we will explore how impulse response can be used to model and analyze the behavior of systems in response to an impulse input.

$$



where the angle brackets indicate the inner product (or dot product) of two vectors.



#### 9.1b Physics of Collisions



In order to fully understand the dynamics of collisions, it is important to have a solid understanding of the underlying physics. When two objects collide, there are several physical principles at play, including conservation of momentum, conservation of energy, and the laws of motion.



##### Conservation of Momentum



One of the most fundamental principles in physics is the conservation of momentum. This states that in a closed system, the total momentum before a collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. In other words, the total amount of momentum in a system remains constant.



In the case of a two-dimensional collision, the momentum of each object can be calculated by multiplying its mass by its velocity in the x and y directions. The total momentum before the collision can then be calculated by adding the individual momentums of each object. After the collision, the total momentum can be calculated in the same way, and it should be equal to the initial total momentum.



##### Conservation of Energy



Another important principle in collisions is the conservation of energy. This states that in a closed system, the total energy before a collision is equal to the total energy after the collision. This means that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred between objects.



In the case of a collision, the total energy before the collision can be calculated by adding the kinetic energy of each object, which is equal to half of its mass multiplied by the square of its velocity. After the collision, the total energy can be calculated in the same way, and it should be equal to the initial total energy.



##### Laws of Motion



The laws of motion, as described by Isaac Newton, also play a crucial role in collisions. These laws state that an object will remain at rest or in motion with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. In the case of a collision, the forces acting on the objects are the contact forces between them.



The first law of motion, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or in motion with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This means that in a collision, the objects will continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed unless acted upon by an external force.



The second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This means that in a collision, the objects will experience a change in acceleration due to the forces acting on them.



The third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that in a collision, the forces acting on the objects will be equal and opposite, causing them to bounce off each other.



In conclusion, understanding the physics behind collisions is crucial in accurately modeling them using impulse response. By considering the principles of conservation of momentum, conservation of energy, and the laws of motion, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of collisions and accurately predict the outcomes of these events.





## Chapter 9: Impulse Response:



### Section: 9.1 Collisions:



Collisions are a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and control. They occur when two or more objects come into contact with each other and exchange energy and momentum. In this section, we will explore the concept of collisions and how they can be modeled using impulse response.



#### 9.1a Introduction to Collisions



Collisions can be classified into two types: elastic and inelastic. In an elastic collision, the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved, while in an inelastic collision, some of the kinetic energy is lost in the form of heat or sound. In this section, we will focus on elastic collisions.



To understand the dynamics of collisions, we can use the concept of impulse response. Impulse response is the change in velocity of an object due to an impulse, which is a sudden change in force over a short period of time. In the case of a collision, the impulse is caused by the contact between two objects.



In a two-dimensional collision with two moving objects, the final velocities of the objects can be calculated using the following equations:



$$

v'_{1x} = \frac{v_{1}\cos(\theta_1-\varphi)(m_1-m_2)+2m_2v_{2}\cos(\theta_2-\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}\cos(\varphi)+v_{1}\sin(\theta_1-\varphi)\cos(\varphi + \tfrac{\pi}{2})

\\[0.8em]

v'_{1y} = \frac{v_{1}\cos(\theta_1-\varphi)(m_1-m_2)+2m_2v_{2}\cos(\theta_2-\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}\sin(\varphi)+v_{1}\sin(\theta_1-\varphi)\sin(\varphi + \tfrac{\pi}{2}),

$$



where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the scalar sizes of the two original speeds of the objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are their masses, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are their movement angles. The lowercase phi ($\varphi$) represents the contact angle between the two objects.



These equations are derived from the fact that the interaction between the two bodies can be easily calculated along the contact angle. By rotating the x and y axes to be parallel with the contact angle, the velocities of the objects can be calculated in one dimension. They can then be rotated back to the original orientation to obtain the true x and y components of the velocities.



In an angle-free representation, the changed velocities are computed using the centers and at the time of contact as:



$$

\mathbf{v}'_1 = \mathbf{v}_1-\frac{2 m_2}{m_1+m_2} \ \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}_1-\mathbf{v}_2,\,\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2\rangle}{\|\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2\|^2} \ (\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2),

\\[0.8em]

\mathbf{v}'_2 = \mathbf{v}_2-\frac{2 m_1}{m_1+m_2} \ \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}_2-\mathbf{v}_1,\,\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1\rangle}{\|\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1\|^2} \ (\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1).

$$



These equations show that the final velocities of the objects depend on their masses, initial velocities, and the contact angle between them. This allows us to model and predict the outcome of a collision using impulse response.



#### 9.1b Types of Collisions



As mentioned earlier, collisions can be classified into elastic and inelastic collisions. In an elastic collision, the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved, while in an inelastic collision, some of the kinetic energy is lost. This loss of energy is due to the conversion of kinetic energy into other forms, such as heat or sound.



In addition to these two types, collisions can also be classified as head-on or oblique collisions. In a head-on collision, the objects collide directly along their line of motion, while in an oblique collision, the objects collide at an angle.



#### 9.1c Applications of Collisions



The study of collisions has many practical applications in various fields. In engineering, collisions are important in designing safety features for vehicles and structures. In physics, collisions are used to study the behavior of particles and their interactions. In robotics, understanding collisions is crucial in designing robots that can navigate and interact with their environment safely.



In conclusion, collisions are a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and control. By using impulse response, we can model and predict the outcome of collisions, which has many practical applications in various fields. In the next section, we will explore the concept of impulse response in more detail and its applications in modeling other dynamic systems.

## Chapter 9: Impulse Response:



### Section: 9.2 Conservation of Momentum:



In the previous section, we explored the concept of collisions and how they can be modeled using impulse response. In this section, we will delve deeper into the underlying principle behind collisions - conservation of momentum.



#### 9.2a Understanding Conservation of Momentum



Conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant over time, unless acted upon by an external force. This means that in a collision, the total momentum of the system before and after the collision remains the same.



To understand this concept better, let us revisit the Cauchy momentum equation introduced in the previous chapter. It states that the change in system momentum is proportional to the resulting force acting on the system. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:



$$

\vec p(t+\Delta t) - \vec p(t) = \Delta t \vec{\bar F}

$$



where $\vec p(t)$ is the momentum in time $t$, $\vec{\bar F}$ is the average force over $\Delta t$. Dividing by $\Delta t$ and taking the limit as $\Delta t \to 0$, we get the derivative:



$$

\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \vec F

$$



Let us now analyze each side of this equation.



### Right side



The right side of the equation represents the resulting force acting on the system. This force can be further divided into two types - body forces and surface forces.



Body forces act on the entire body of the system, such as gravity or electromagnetic forces. On the other hand, surface forces act on the surface of the system, such as contact forces in a collision.



### Left side



The left side of the equation represents the change in momentum of the system. In a collision, this change in momentum is caused by the impulse, which is a sudden change in force over a short period of time.



By understanding the underlying principle of conservation of momentum, we can better understand the dynamics of collisions and use impulse response to model them accurately. In the next section, we will explore the concept of impulse response in more detail and see how it can be applied to different types of collisions.

The left side of the equation represents the change in momentum of the system. In a collision, this change in momentum is caused by the impulse, which is a sudden change in force over a short period of time.



By understanding the underlying principle of conservation of momentum, we can better understand the behavior of systems in collisions. This principle has many applications in various fields, such as engineering, physics, and even sports.



### Subsection: 9.2b Applications of Conservation of Momentum



The conservation of momentum principle has many practical applications in engineering and physics. One of the most common applications is in analyzing collisions between objects.



In a collision, the total momentum of the system before and after the collision remains the same. This allows us to calculate the velocities of the objects involved in the collision using the conservation of momentum equation. By knowing the initial and final momentums of the system, we can determine the change in momentum and thus, the velocities of the objects.



Another application of conservation of momentum is in rocket propulsion. The principle states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that when a rocket expels gas at high speeds, the rocket itself experiences an equal and opposite force in the opposite direction, propelling it forward.



In addition, the conservation of momentum principle is also used in designing safety features for vehicles. By understanding the forces involved in a collision, engineers can design crumple zones and airbags to reduce the impact force and protect the passengers inside.



Overall, the conservation of momentum principle is a powerful tool in understanding and predicting the behavior of systems in collisions. Its applications are vast and continue to be explored in various fields of study.

## Chapter 9: Impulse Response:



### Section: 9.2 Conservation of Momentum:



In the previous section, we explored the concept of collisions and how they can be modeled using impulse response. In this section, we will delve deeper into the underlying principle behind collisions - conservation of momentum.



#### 9.2a Understanding Conservation of Momentum



Conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant over time, unless acted upon by an external force. This means that in a collision, the total momentum of the system before and after the collision remains the same.



To understand this concept better, let us revisit the Cauchy momentum equation introduced in the previous chapter. It states that the change in system momentum is proportional to the resulting force acting on the system. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:



$$

\vec p(t+\Delta t) - \vec p(t) = \Delta t \vec{\bar F}

$$



where $\vec p(t)$ is the momentum in time $t$, $\vec{\bar F}$ is the average force over $\Delta t$. Dividing by $\Delta t$ and taking the limit as $\Delta t \to 0$, we get the derivative:



$$

\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \vec F

$$



Let us now analyze each side of this equation.



### Right side



The right side of the equation represents the resulting force acting on the system. This force can be further divided into two types - body forces and surface forces.



Body forces act on the entire body of the system, such as gravity or electromagnetic forces. On the other hand, surface forces act on the surface of the system, such as contact forces in a collision.



### Left side



The left side of the equation represents the change in momentum of the system. In a collision, this change in momentum is caused by the impulse, which is a sudden change in force over a short period of time.



By understanding the underlying principle of conservation of momentum, we can better understand the behavior of a system during a collision. However, there are some challenges in accurately modeling conservation of momentum, which we will explore in the next subsection.



#### 9.2b Challenges in Conservation of Momentum



While the concept of conservation of momentum is straightforward, accurately modeling it can be challenging. One of the main challenges is the presence of external forces acting on the system, which can affect the total momentum and make it difficult to accurately predict the outcome of a collision.



Another challenge is the assumption of a closed system. In reality, most systems are not completely isolated and may experience external forces that can affect the conservation of momentum.



Additionally, the accuracy of the model depends on the accuracy of the measurements and assumptions made about the system. Small errors in measurements or assumptions can lead to significant discrepancies in the predicted outcome of a collision.



Despite these challenges, conservation of momentum remains a fundamental principle in physics and is crucial in understanding the dynamics of a system during a collision. In the next section, we will explore how this principle can be applied in real-world scenarios through the use of impulse response.

### Section: 9.3 Conservation of Energy:



### Subsection (optional): 9.3a Understanding Conservation of Energy



In the previous section, we explored the concept of conservation of momentum and its application in modeling collisions. In this section, we will delve into another fundamental principle in physics - conservation of energy.



#### 9.3a Understanding Conservation of Energy



Conservation of energy is a fundamental law in physics that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. This means that in a closed system, the total energy remains constant over time.



To understand this concept better, let us revisit the general equation of heat transfer introduced in the previous chapter. It states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the sum of heat transfer and work done on the system. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:



$$

\rho \frac{d\varepsilon}{dt} = \rho T \frac{ds}{dt} - \frac{p}{\rho} \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v})

$$



where $\rho$ is the density, $\varepsilon$ is the internal energy, $T$ is the temperature, $s$ is the specific entropy, $p$ is the pressure, and $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the system.



This equation can also be written in terms of the change in specific entropy, which is a more useful form for understanding conservation of energy:



$$

\rho T \frac{ds}{dt} = \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) + \frac{\mu}{2} \left( \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i} - \frac{2}{3} \delta_{ij} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} \right)^2 + \zeta (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v})^2

$$



where $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\zeta$ is the bulk viscosity.



### Application



This equation is derived in Section 49, at the opening of the chapter on "Thermal Conduction in Fluids" in the sixth volume of L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz's "Course of Theoretical Physics". It can be used to measure the heat transfer and air flow in a domestic refrigerator, to do a harmonic analysis of regenerators, or to understand the physics of glaciers.



### Thermal Energy Storage



Thermal energy storage is an important application of conservation of energy. It involves storing thermal energy in a system for later use. One example of this is hot silicon technology, where thermal energy is stored in silicon for use in solar power plants.



In order to effectively store thermal energy, it is important to understand the principles of conservation of energy and how it applies to different systems. This can be achieved by studying the equation for specific entropy production, which shows that in the absence of thermal conduction and viscous forces, the entropy production is zero. This means that ideal fluid flow is isentropic, and understanding this concept is crucial in designing efficient thermal energy storage systems.



By understanding the principles of conservation of energy, we can better understand and model the dynamics of various systems, leading to more efficient and sustainable technologies. In the next section, we will explore the concept of impulse response in the context of conservation of energy.

### Section: 9.3 Conservation of Energy:



### Subsection (optional): 9.3b Applications of Conservation of Energy



In the previous section, we explored the concept of conservation of energy and its fundamental role in physics. In this section, we will delve into some practical applications of this principle, specifically in the context of dynamics and control.



#### 9.3b Applications of Conservation of Energy



One of the most common applications of conservation of energy in dynamics and control is in the analysis of mechanical systems. In these systems, energy can be transferred and converted between different forms, such as potential and kinetic energy. However, the total energy of the system remains constant.



To better understand this concept, let us consider a simple example of a mass-spring system. In this system, a mass is attached to a spring and can move back and forth. The potential energy of the system is stored in the spring, while the kinetic energy is associated with the motion of the mass. According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy of the system (potential + kinetic) must remain constant.



This concept can be mathematically expressed using the general equation of heat transfer introduced in the previous chapter. In this case, the internal energy of the system is equal to the sum of the potential and kinetic energy, and the equation can be written as:



$$

\rho \frac{d\varepsilon}{dt} = \rho T \frac{ds}{dt} - \frac{p}{\rho} \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v})

$$



where $\rho$ is the density, $\varepsilon$ is the internal energy, $T$ is the temperature, $s$ is the specific entropy, $p$ is the pressure, and $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the system.



This equation can also be written in terms of the change in specific entropy, which is a more useful form for understanding conservation of energy:



$$

\rho T \frac{ds}{dt} = \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) + \frac{\mu}{2} \left( \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i} - \frac{2}{3} \delta_{ij} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} \right)^2 + \zeta (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v})^2

$$



where $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\zeta$ is the bulk viscosity.



### Application



This equation is derived in Section 49, at the opening of the chapter on "Thermal Conduction in Fluids" in the sixth volume of L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz's "Course of Theoretical Physics". It can be used to analyze the energy transfer and conversion in various mechanical systems, such as the mass-spring system mentioned above. By understanding the principles of conservation of energy, engineers and scientists can design and control these systems more effectively.

## Chapter 9: Impulse Response:



### Section: 9.3 Conservation of Energy:



### Subsection (optional): 9.3c Challenges in Conservation of Energy



In the previous section, we explored the concept of conservation of energy and its applications in dynamics and control. However, there are some challenges that arise when trying to apply this principle in real-world systems.



One of the main challenges is the presence of external forces that can affect the energy of a system. In the example of the mass-spring system, we assumed that there were no external forces acting on the mass. However, in reality, there are always external forces present, such as friction or air resistance, that can dissipate energy and affect the overall dynamics of the system.



Another challenge is the presence of non-conservative forces, which do not follow the principle of conservation of energy. These forces can change the total energy of a system, making it difficult to accurately model and predict its behavior.



Furthermore, the assumption of a closed system, where no energy is exchanged with the surroundings, is often not realistic. In many real-world systems, energy is constantly being exchanged with the environment, making it challenging to accurately track and analyze the energy balance of the system.



To address these challenges, advanced techniques such as control theory and system identification are often used. These methods allow for the modeling and control of complex systems, taking into account external forces and non-conservative forces.



In conclusion, while the principle of conservation of energy is a fundamental concept in dynamics and control, there are challenges that must be considered when applying it to real-world systems. By using advanced techniques and models, we can overcome these challenges and better understand the dynamics and control of complex systems.

### Section: 10.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 10.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of plane-motion kinematics and how it applies to rigid bodies. Now, we will delve deeper into understanding the key concepts and principles of plane-motion kinematics.



#### Kinematic Width



Before we dive into the specifics of plane-motion kinematics, it is important to understand the concept of kinematic width. Kinematic width refers to the extent of a moving set of points, and it plays a crucial role in understanding the motion of rigid bodies. In order to accurately model the dynamics and control of a rigid body, we must first understand its kinematic width.

##### Conversion from Axis-Angle



One of the most commonly used rotation formalisms in three dimensions is the axis-angle representation. This involves representing the rotation of a rigid body as a rotation about a fixed axis by a certain angle. The input axis is typically denoted as <math>{a} = [{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math> and must be normalized for accurate calculations.



#### Extended Kalman Filter



The extended Kalman filter is a powerful tool used in state estimation and control of dynamic systems. It is an extension of the traditional Kalman filter, which is used for linear systems. The extended Kalman filter allows for the estimation of states in nonlinear systems by using a linear approximation. It is widely used in various fields, including aerospace engineering, robotics, and control systems.



##### Generalizations



The extended Kalman filter has several generalizations that are commonly used in different applications. One of these is the continuous-time extended Kalman filter, which is used for continuous-time systems. It involves predicting and updating the state of a system based on continuous-time measurements.



###### Continuous-time Extended Kalman Filter Model



The continuous-time extended Kalman filter model is given by the following equations:



$$

\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr)

$$



$$

\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)

$$



$$

\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t_0)=E\bigl[\mathbf{x}(t_0)\bigr] \text{, } \mathbf{P}(t_0)=Var\bigl[\mathbf{x}(t_0)\bigr]

$$



$$

\dot{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}(t) = f\bigl(\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)\bigr)+\mathbf{K}(t)\Bigl(\mathbf{z}(t)-h\bigl(\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)\bigr)\Bigr)

$$



$$

\dot{\mathbf{P}}(t) = \mathbf{F}(t)\mathbf{P}(t)+\mathbf{P}(t)\mathbf{F}(t)^{T}-\mathbf{K}(t)\mathbf{H}(t)\mathbf{P}(t)+\mathbf{Q}(t)

$$



$$

\mathbf{K}(t) = \mathbf{P}(t)\mathbf{H}(t)^{T}\mathbf{R}(t)^{-1}

$$



$$

\mathbf{F}(t) = \left . \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{x} } \right \vert _{\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)}

$$



$$

\mathbf{H}(t) = \left . \frac{\partial h}{\partial \mathbf{x} } \right \vert _{\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)} 

$$



Unlike the discrete-time extended Kalman filter, the prediction and update steps are coupled in the continuous-time extended Kalman filter. This allows for more accurate estimation of states in continuous-time systems.



###### Discrete-time Measurements



In many real-world applications, measurements are taken at discrete time intervals. In this case, the system model and measurement model are given by:



$$

\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr)

$$



$$

\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)

$$



The discrete-time extended Kalman filter is commonly used in applications where measurements are taken at discrete time intervals, such as in digital control systems.

### Subsection: 10.2c Challenges in Plane-motion Kinematics



In the previous section, we discussed the fundamentals of plane-motion kinematics and its applications in various fields. However, like any other mathematical concept, plane-motion kinematics also presents some challenges that must be addressed in order to fully understand and utilize it.



#### Non-uniqueness of Solutions



One of the main challenges in plane-motion kinematics is the non-uniqueness of solutions.

This is an important topic in the study of mechanics, as it allows us to understand and predict the motion of objects in real-world scenarios.



#### Equations of Motion



The equations of motion for a rigid body in plane motion can be derived using Newton's second law and the principle of conservation of angular momentum. These equations describe the relationship between the forces acting on the body, its mass and inertia, and its resulting motion. They can be written as:



$$

\sum \mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}_G

$$



$$

\sum \mathbf{M}_G = I_G\dot{\mathbf{\omega}} + \mathbf{\omega} \times I_G\mathbf{\omega}

$$



where $\mathbf{F}$ is the total force acting on the body, $m$ is its mass, $\mathbf{a}_G$ is the acceleration of its center of mass, $\mathbf{M}_G$ is the total moment acting on the body, $I_G$ is its moment of inertia about the center of mass, and $\mathbf{\omega}$ is its angular velocity.



#### Non-uniqueness of Solutions



Similar to plane-motion kinematics, one of the main challenges in plane-motion dynamics is the non-uniqueness of solutions. This means that for a given set of initial conditions, there may be multiple solutions that satisfy the equations of motion. This can make it difficult to accurately predict the motion of a rigid body, especially in complex systems.



#### Singularities



Singularities can also occur in the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion. These can arise when the equations of motion become undefined or infinite, leading to unpredictable behavior. For example, in a system with multiple degrees of freedom, a singularity may occur when two or more joints align, causing a loss of control over the motion of the body.



#### Computational Complexity



The equations of motion for plane-motion dynamics can become quite complex, especially for systems with multiple degrees of freedom. This can make it challenging to analyze and solve these equations, requiring advanced mathematical techniques and computational power. In some cases, numerical methods may be necessary to obtain a solution.



#### Real-world Limitations



In real-world applications, there are often limitations and constraints that must be considered when modeling the motion of a rigid body. These can include factors such as friction, external forces, and material properties. Incorporating these limitations into the equations of motion can add another layer of complexity to the problem.



#### Assumptions and Simplifications



Similar to plane-motion kinematics, assumptions and simplifications are often made in the study of plane-motion dynamics. These can include assuming a rigid body, neglecting certain forces or constraints, or using simplified models. While these simplifications can make the equations of motion more manageable, they may also lead to less accurate predictions of the body's motion.



In the next section, we will explore some common techniques for solving the equations of motion for rigid bodies in plane motion. These techniques will help us better understand and analyze the dynamics of real-world systems.

Another challenge in plane-motion dynamics is the presence of singularities. These are points in the motion of a rigid body where the equations of motion become undefined or infinite. Singularities can occur when certain forces or moments are applied, or when the body reaches a certain configuration.



To overcome this challenge, it is important to carefully analyze the equations of motion and identify potential singularities. In some cases, it may be possible to avoid these points by adjusting the system design or control inputs. In other cases, it may be necessary to use advanced techniques such as singularity avoidance algorithms or adaptive control methods.



#### Computational Complexity



The equations of motion for a rigid body in plane motion can be quite complex, especially when considering the effects of non-uniqueness and singularities. This can make it challenging to accurately model and analyze the behavior of a system, particularly in real-time applications.



To address this challenge, it is important to use efficient computational methods and algorithms. This may involve simplifying the equations of motion or using numerical techniques such as finite element analysis or multibody simulation. Additionally, the use of advanced control strategies such as model predictive control can help to reduce the computational complexity and improve the accuracy of the model.

## Chapter 11: Brief Review of 2.003:



### Section: 11.1 Uniaxial Motion:



In this section, we will provide a brief review of uniaxial motion, a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and control. Uniaxial motion refers to the motion of an object along a single axis, which can be described using a one-dimensional coordinate system. This type of motion is commonly encountered in many engineering systems, such as a simple pendulum, a mass-spring system, or a car moving along a straight road.



To understand uniaxial motion, we must first review the concept of rotation formalisms in three dimensions. One commonly used formalism is the axis-angle representation, which describes a rotation using an axis of rotation and an angle of rotation around that axis. This representation assumes that the input axis <math>{a} = [{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math> is normalized, meaning that its magnitude is equal to 1.



Another important concept in uniaxial motion is rational motion, which refers to the motion of an object that can be described using rational functions. These functions are ratios of two polynomials, and they are commonly used to model complex motions in engineering systems.



Moving on to the topic of rational Bézier and B-spline motions, we can use dual quaternions to represent the motion of an object in three-dimensional space. A dual quaternion is a pair of quaternions, where one quaternion represents the rotation of the object and the other represents its translation. This representation is obtained by expanding <math>\hat {\textbf{Q}} = \hat {w} \hat {\textbf{q}}</math> using dual number algebra.



Using dual quaternions, we can define a rational Bézier curve, which represents a smooth and continuous motion of an object. This curve is defined by a set of unit dual quaternions and dual weights, and it can be expressed as a sum of Bernstein polynomials. Similarly, a B-spline dual quaternion curve can be defined, which represents a NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline) motion of an object.



In terms of control, understanding uniaxial motion is crucial for designing controllers that can accurately track and control the motion of an object. By modeling the dynamics of a system using rational functions and dual quaternions, we can design controllers that can effectively control the motion of the system.



In conclusion, uniaxial motion is a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and control. By understanding the rotation formalisms in three dimensions, rational motion, and rational Bézier and B-spline motions, we can effectively model and control the motion of objects in engineering systems. This knowledge will be essential for the rest of this book as we dive deeper into the world of Modeling Dynamics and Control II.

This representation is useful for visualizing the orientation of an object, but it can lead to singularities and complications in calculations.



In addition to rotation formalisms, we must also review the concept of Poinsot's ellipsoid, which is a geometric construction used to visualize the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. This construction is based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum and can be used to understand the orientation of a spacecraft in space.



Moving on to the topic of rational motion, we will explore the applications of this concept in engineering systems. Rational motion refers to the motion of an object that can be described using rational functions. These functions are ratios of two polynomials, and they are commonly used to model complex motions in engineering systems. One example of rational motion is the motion of a spacecraft in orbit, which can be described using Kepler's laws of planetary motion.



### Subsection: 11.1b Applications of Uniaxial Motion

Another important application of uniaxial motion is in the design of suspension systems for vehicles. By understanding the dynamics of uniaxial motion, engineers can design suspension systems that provide a smooth and stable ride for passengers while also ensuring the safety and stability of the vehicle.



In addition to these applications, uniaxial motion is also used in the design of control systems for various engineering systems. By modeling the dynamics of uniaxial motion, engineers can design control systems that can accurately and efficiently regulate the motion of an object along a single axis.

Now, let's focus on uniaxial motion specifically. One challenge in uniaxial motion is dealing with differential constraints. These constraints can be either holonomic or nonholonomic. Holonomic constraints are those that can be expressed as equations between the coordinates of the system, while nonholonomic constraints cannot be expressed in this way. These constraints can greatly affect the motion of a system and must be carefully considered in the modeling process.



Another challenge in uniaxial motion is dealing with hybrid systems. These systems combine both discrete and continuous behavior, making them more complex to model and control. One example of a hybrid system is a car with an automatic transmission, where the gear shifts are discrete events while the motion of the car is continuous.



To overcome these challenges, various methods have been developed, such as the Gauss-Seidel method for solving differential equations and the finite element method for structural mechanics. These methods allow for more accurate and efficient modeling of uniaxial motion in engineering systems.



In conclusion, uniaxial motion is a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and control, and it is encountered in many engineering systems. Understanding the various challenges and methods for modeling uniaxial motion is crucial for designing and controlling these systems effectively.

## Chapter 11: Brief Review of 2.003:



### Section: 11.2 Fixed-axis Rotation:



In this section, we will continue our review of 2.003 by discussing fixed-axis rotation. This type of rotation occurs when an object rotates around a single, fixed axis. It is a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and control, as it is commonly encountered in many engineering systems, such as rotating machinery, satellites, and aircraft.



To understand fixed-axis rotation, we must first review the concept of rotation matrices. A rotation matrix is a mathematical tool used to describe the orientation of an object in three-dimensional space. It is a 3x3 matrix that defines the angular position of a reference frame relative to a fixed frame. In the case of fixed-axis rotation, the reference frame is rotating around a fixed axis, and the rotation matrix takes a simple form.



One important property of rotation matrices is that they are orthogonal, meaning that their inverse is equal to their transpose. This property allows us to easily convert between different rotation formalisms, such as axis-angle and Euler angles, by simply multiplying the appropriate rotation matrices.



Next, we will discuss the concept of angular velocity and its relationship to fixed-axis rotation. Angular velocity is a vector quantity that describes the rate of change of an object's angular position. In the case of fixed-axis rotation, the angular velocity vector is parallel to the axis of rotation and has a magnitude equal to the rate of change of the rotation angle.



We can also use rotation matrices to describe the velocity and acceleration of a point on a rotating object. By taking the time derivative of the rotation matrix, we can obtain the angular velocity matrix, which relates the velocity of a point in the rotating frame to its velocity in the fixed frame. Similarly, the acceleration of a point in the rotating frame can be described using the angular acceleration matrix, which is the time derivative of the angular velocity matrix.



Finally, we will discuss the concept of moment of inertia and its importance in fixed-axis rotation. Moment of inertia is a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion and is dependent on the object's mass distribution and the axis of rotation. It plays a crucial role in the design and control of rotating machinery, as well as in the stability and maneuverability of aircraft and spacecraft.



In summary, fixed-axis rotation is a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and control, and a thorough understanding of it is essential for engineers and scientists working in various fields. In the next section, we will apply these concepts to analyze the dynamics and control of rotating systems in more detail.

By accurately modeling the dynamics of fixed-axis rotation, engineers can design control systems to maintain the desired orientation of these objects in space.



Another interesting application of fixed-axis rotation is in the study of Poinsot's ellipsoid. This ellipsoid is a geometric representation of the motion of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. It is a useful tool for visualizing and understanding the complex motion of rotating objects.



In addition to these applications, fixed-axis rotation is also used in various mathematical techniques, such as line integral convolution and vector rotation.

### Subsection: 11.2c Challenges in Fixed-axis Rotation



While fixed-axis rotation is a fundamental concept in dynamics and control, it also presents some challenges in modeling and analysis. One of the main challenges is dealing with non-inertial reference frames. In fixed-axis rotation, the reference frame is rotating, which means that it is not an inertial frame of reference. This can complicate the equations of motion and make it more difficult to analyze the system.



Another challenge is dealing with the effects of external forces on the rotating object. In a non-rotating object, external forces can be easily accounted for by using Newton's laws of motion. However, in a rotating object, these forces can cause additional torques and moments that must be considered in the equations of motion.



In addition, fixed-axis rotation can also lead to gyroscopic effects, which can have a significant impact on the behavior of the system. Gyroscopic effects occur when a rotating object experiences a force that is perpendicular to both the axis of rotation and the direction of the force. This can cause the object to precess, or rotate around a different axis, which can complicate the analysis of the system.



Despite these challenges, fixed-axis rotation remains an important concept in dynamics and control, and understanding its complexities is crucial for engineers and scientists working with rotating systems. In the next section, we will explore some applications of fixed-axis rotation and see how it is used in real-world engineering systems.

#### 11.3a Understanding First Order Systems



First order systems are characterized by a single differential equation that relates the input and output of the system. They are often used to model systems with a single energy storage element, such as a capacitor or an inductor. In these systems, the output is directly proportional to the input, with a time constant that depends on the energy storage element.



To better understand first order systems, let's consider the example of an RC circuit. In this circuit, a resistor (R) and a capacitor (C) are connected in series with a voltage source. The voltage across the capacitor (Vc) can be described by the following first order differential equation:



$$

\frac{dV_c}{dt} = \frac{1}{RC}(V_{in} - V_c)

$$



where V_{in} is the input voltage and RC is the time constant of the circuit. This equation shows that the rate of change of the output voltage is directly proportional to the difference between the input voltage and the current voltage across the capacitor.



Another important concept in first order systems is the step response. This is the response of the system to a sudden change in the input, such as a step function. In the case of the RC circuit, the step response can be calculated using the following equation:



$$

V_c(t) = V_{in}(1-e^{-\frac{t}{RC}})

$$



This equation shows that the output voltage will approach the input voltage exponentially with a time constant of RC. This is a fundamental property of first order systems and is used to analyze and design control systems.



Moving on to second order systems, these are characterized by two differential equations that relate the input and output of the system. They are often used to model systems with two energy storage elements, such as a mass-spring-damper system. In these systems, the output is influenced by both the input and the state of the system, making them more complex than first order systems.



To better understand second order systems, let's consider the example of a mass-spring-damper system. In this system, a mass (m) is connected to a spring (k) and a damper (b). The displacement of the mass (x) can be described by the following second order differential equation:



$$

m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + b\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = F_{in}

$$



where F_{in} is the input force. This equation shows that the acceleration of the mass is influenced by both the input force and the current displacement and velocity of the mass.



Similar to first order systems, the step response of a second order system can also be calculated. However, in this case, the response will depend on the damping ratio of the system, which is a measure of how much the system is damped. A higher damping ratio results in a slower response and less oscillation, while a lower damping ratio results in a faster response and more oscillation.



In conclusion, first and second order systems are fundamental concepts in the study of dynamics and control. They are used to model a wide range of physical systems and are essential for understanding the behavior and designing control strategies for these systems. In the next section, we will discuss more advanced systems and their applications in engineering.

### Section: 11.3 First and Second Order Systems:



In this section, we will continue our review of 2.003 by discussing first and second order systems. These types of systems are commonly encountered in engineering and are essential for understanding the dynamics and control of many physical systems.



#### 11.3a Understanding First Order Systems



First order systems are characterized by a single differential equation that relates the input and output of the system. They are often used to model systems with a single energy storage element, such as a capacitor or an inductor. In these systems, the output is directly proportional to the input, with a time constant that depends on the energy storage element.



To better understand first order systems, let's consider the example of an RC circuit. In this circuit, a resistor (R) and a capacitor (C) are connected in series with a voltage source. The voltage across the capacitor (Vc) can be described by the following first order differential equation:



$$

\frac{dV_c}{dt} = \frac{1}{RC}(V_{in} - V_c)

$$



where V_{in} is the input voltage and RC is the time constant of the circuit. This equation shows that the rate of change of the output voltage is directly proportional to the difference between the input voltage and the current voltage across the capacitor.



Another important concept in first order systems is the step response. This is the response of the system to a sudden change in the input, such as a step function. In the case of the RC circuit, the step response can be calculated using the following equation:



$$

V_c(t) = V_{in}(1-e^{-\frac{t}{RC}})

$$



This equation shows that the output voltage will approach the input voltage exponentially with a time constant of RC. This is a fundamental property of first order systems and is used to analyze and design control systems.



Moving on to second order systems, these are characterized by two differential equations that relate the input and output of the system. They are commonly used to model systems with two energy storage elements, such as a mass-spring-damper system. The equations of motion for a second order system can be written as:



$$

\ddot{x} + 2\zeta\omega_n\dot{x} + \omega_n^2x = u

$$



where x is the output, u is the input, and \zeta and \omega_n are the damping ratio and natural frequency of the system, respectively. The damping ratio \zeta determines the type of response of the system, whether it is underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped.



Similar to first order systems, the step response of a second order system can also be calculated. In the case of a mass-spring-damper system, the step response can be written as:



$$

x(t) = \frac{u}{\omega_n^2}(1-e^{-\zeta\omega_nt}) + \frac{\dot{u} + \zeta\omega_nu}{\omega_n^2}e^{-\zeta\omega_nt}

$$



This equation shows that the output will approach the input with a time constant of \zeta\omega_n. The behavior of second order systems is more complex than first order systems, but they are still fundamental in understanding the dynamics and control of many physical systems.



In conclusion, first and second order systems are essential for understanding the dynamics and control of physical systems. They are commonly encountered in engineering and have important applications in various fields. By understanding the properties and behaviors of these systems, we can better analyze and design control systems for a wide range of applications.

### Section: 11.3 First and Second Order Systems:



In this section, we will continue our review of 2.003 by discussing first and second order systems. These types of systems are commonly encountered in engineering and are essential for understanding the dynamics and control of many physical systems.

$$



This equation shows that the output voltage will approach the input voltage exponentially with a time constant of RC. This is a fundamental property of first order systems and is used to analyze and design control systems.



#### 11.3b Understanding Second Order Systems



Second order systems are characterized by two differential equations that relate the input and output of the system. They are often used to model systems with two energy storage elements, such as a mass-spring-damper system. In these systems, the output is influenced by both the input and the state of the system, making them more complex than first order systems.



To better understand second order systems, let's consider the example of a mass-spring-damper system. In this system, a mass (m) is attached to a spring (k) and a damper (b). The position of the mass (x) can be described by the following second order differential equation:



$$

m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + b\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = F_{in}

$$



where F_{in} is the input force. This equation shows that the acceleration of the mass is influenced by both the input force and the current position and velocity of the mass.



Similar to first order systems, second order systems also have a step response. However, the step response for a second order system is more complex and can be calculated using the following equation:



$$

x(t) = \frac{F_{in}}{k}(1-e^{-\frac{bt}{2m}}\cos(\omega t + \phi))

$$



where \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} is the natural frequency of the system and \phi is the phase angle. This equation shows that the output of a second order system will oscillate around the input value before settling to the steady-state value.



### 11.3c Comparing First and Second Order Systems



Now that we have a better understanding of first and second order systems, let's compare them. First order systems are simpler and easier to analyze, but they are limited in their ability to model complex systems. Second order systems, on the other hand, are more complex but can model a wider range of systems.



One key difference between first and second order systems is their step response. First order systems have a single time constant that determines how quickly the output will approach the input value. Second order systems, on the other hand, have two time constants - the natural frequency and the damping ratio - that determine the behavior of the step response.



Another difference is the presence of oscillations in the output of second order systems. This is due to the presence of the natural frequency, which causes the system to oscillate around the input value before settling to the steady-state value. First order systems do not exhibit this behavior.



In conclusion, first and second order systems have their own unique characteristics and are suitable for modeling different types of systems. It is important for engineers to understand the differences between these two types of systems in order to effectively analyze and design control systems.

In this section, we will provide a brief review of the concepts covered in 2.003, an introductory course on dynamics and control at MIT. This will serve as a refresher for those who have taken the course and as an introduction for those who have not.



#### 12.1a Overview of 2.003



2.003 is a fundamental course that introduces students to the principles of dynamics and control. It is a continuation of the first course, 2.001, which covers statics and basic dynamics. In 2.003, we will build upon the concepts learned in 2.001 and apply them to more complex systems. The course is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in these concepts, which are essential for understanding the dynamics and control of mechanical systems.

#### 12.1b Key Concepts from 2.003



In this subsection, we will highlight some of the key concepts covered in 2.003 that are relevant to our discussion on plane-motion dynamics of rigid bodies.



One of the key concepts in 2.003 is the concept of inertia, which is the resistance of a body to changes in its state of motion. Inertia is dependent on the mass and distribution of mass of a body. We will review the concept of moment of inertia, which is a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion, and how it is related to the distribution of mass in a body.



Another important concept is the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. We will discuss how this principle applies to mechanical systems and how it can be used to analyze the motion of a rigid body.



We will also review the concept of work and power, which are important in understanding the energy transfer in a system. Work is defined as the product of force and displacement, while power is the rate at which work is done. We will explore how these concepts are related to the motion of a rigid body and how they can be used to analyze the performance of a system.



Finally, we will discuss control systems and their role in dynamics. A control system is a system that uses feedback to maintain a desired output or state. We will learn about different types of control systems and how they can be used to control the motion of a rigid body.



In conclusion, this brief review of 2.003 has provided us with a solid foundation in the key concepts of dynamics and control that will be essential in our study of plane-motion dynamics of rigid bodies.

#### 12.1b Equations of Motion for a Rigid Body



In 2.003, we learned that the equations of motion for a rigid body can be derived from Newton's laws of motion. These laws state that the sum of all forces acting on a body is equal to its mass times its acceleration. For a rigid body, this can be expressed as:



$$

\Sigma F = m\ddot{x}

$$



Where $\Sigma F$ is the sum of all external forces acting on the body, $m$ is the mass of the body, and $\ddot{x}$ is the acceleration of the body's center of mass.



We also learned that the equations of motion can be expressed in terms of angular quantities. For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, the equations of motion can be written as:



$$

\Sigma M = I\ddot{\theta}

$$



Where $\Sigma M$ is the sum of all external torques acting on the body, $I$ is the moment of inertia of the body about the axis of rotation, and $\ddot{\theta}$ is the angular acceleration of the body.



#### 12.1c Applications from 2.003



In 2.003, we studied the dynamics of various mechanical systems, including pendulums, springs, and gears. We learned how to model these systems using the equations of motion and how to analyze their behavior using principles of dynamics and control.



One of the key applications of the concepts learned in 2.003 is in the design and control of robots. By understanding the dynamics of rigid bodies, we can design robots that can move and manipulate objects in a controlled manner. We can also use control theory to develop algorithms that allow robots to perform complex tasks.



Another important application is in the design of vehicles, such as airplanes and cars. By understanding the dynamics of rigid bodies, we can design vehicles that are stable and maneuverable. We can also use control theory to develop systems that improve the performance and safety of these vehicles.



In later sections, we will explore these and other applications in more detail, building upon the foundation laid in 2.003.

## Chapter 12: Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 12.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



In this section, we will delve deeper into the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion. As a refresher, kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. In the previous section, we briefly discussed the different methods of describing the motion of a rigid body. Now, we will focus on understanding the kinematics of plane motion in more detail.



#### 12.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



To begin, let us define plane motion as the motion of a rigid body in a plane, where all points in the body move in parallel planes. This type of motion is commonly seen in systems such as aircraft, cars, and robots. In order to fully understand plane-motion kinematics, we must first define the different types of motion that a rigid body can exhibit.



The first type of motion is translation, which is the motion of a body along a straight line. This type of motion is characterized by a constant velocity and zero angular velocity. In other words, all points in the body move in the same direction and at the same speed. This type of motion is commonly seen in systems such as cars and trains.



The second type of motion is rotation, which is the motion of a body about a fixed axis. This type of motion is characterized by a constant angular velocity and zero linear velocity. In other words, all points in the body move in circular paths around the fixed axis at the same speed. This type of motion is commonly seen in systems such as propellers and wheels.



Finally, we have general plane motion, which is a combination of translation and rotation. This type of motion is characterized by both linear and angular velocities. In this case, different points in the body may have different velocities and directions of motion. This type of motion is commonly seen in systems such as helicopters and robots.



Now that we have defined the different types of motion, let us discuss the methods of describing the motion of a rigid body. The most common method is using position, velocity, and acceleration vectors. These vectors describe the location, speed, and change in speed of a point on the body, respectively. Another method is using angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration, which describe the rotation of the body about a fixed axis.



In conclusion, understanding the kinematics of plane motion is crucial for analyzing and designing systems that exhibit this type of motion. By defining the different types of motion and methods of describing them, we can better understand the behavior of rigid bodies in plane motion. In the next section, we will apply these concepts to the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion.





# Title: Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 12: Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 12.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



In this section, we will continue our discussion on the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion. As we have previously defined, plane motion is the motion of a rigid body in a plane, where all points in the body move in parallel planes. In this section, we will explore the applications of plane-motion kinematics and how it can be used to analyze and model various systems.



#### 12.2b Applications of Plane-motion Kinematics



One of the main applications of plane-motion kinematics is in the design and analysis of factory automation infrastructure. This includes systems such as robotic arms, conveyor belts, and assembly lines. By understanding the kinematics of plane motion, engineers can optimize the movement and coordination of these systems to increase efficiency and productivity.



Another important application is in the visualization of the rotation of spacecraft in orbit. Poinsot's ellipsoid, also known as the kinetic width, is a geometric construction that is used to visualize the rotation of a spacecraft. This is based on the principles of plane-motion kinematics and is a valuable tool for engineers and scientists in the aerospace industry.



In addition, plane-motion kinematics is also used in the design and analysis of various vehicles, such as cars, aircraft, and trains. By understanding the different types of motion that a rigid body can exhibit, engineers can design and optimize the movement of these vehicles for safe and efficient operation.



Further reading on this topic can be found in the paper "Maintaining the extent of a moving set of points" by P. K. Agarwal, L. J. Guibas, J. Hershberger, and E. Verach. This paper discusses the use of plane-motion kinematics in maintaining the extent of a moving set of points, which has applications in various fields such as computer graphics and robotics.

# Title: Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 12: Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 12.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



In this section, we will continue our discussion on the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion. As we have previously defined, plane motion is the motion of a rigid body in a plane, where all points in the body move in parallel planes. In this section, we will explore the applications of plane-motion kinematics and how it can be used to analyze and model various systems.



#### 12.2b Applications of Plane-motion Kinematics



One of the main applications of plane-motion kinematics is in the design and analysis of factory automation infrastructure. This includes systems such as robotic arms, conveyor belts, and assembly lines. By understanding the kinematics of plane motion, engineers can optimize the movement and coordination of these systems to increase efficiency and productivity.



Another important application is in the visualization of the rotation of spacecraft in orbit. Poinsot's ellipsoid, also known as the kinetic width, is a geometric construction that is used to visualize the rotation of a spacecraft. This is based on the principles of plane-motion kinematics and is a valuable tool for engineers and scientists in the aerospace industry.



In addition, plane-motion kinematics is also used in the design and analysis of various vehicles, such as cars, aircraft, and trains. By understanding the different types of motion that a rigid body can exhibit, engineers can design and optimize the movement of these vehicles for safe and efficient operation.



Further reading on this topic can be found in the paper "Maintaining the extent of a moving set of points" by P. K. Agarwal, L. J. Guibas, J. Hershberger, and E. Verach. This paper discusses the use of plane-motion kinematics in maintaining the extent of a moving set of points, which has applications in various fields such as computer graphics and robotics.



#### 12.2c Challenges in Plane-motion Kinematics



While plane-motion kinematics has many practical applications, there are also challenges that arise when trying to model and analyze systems using this concept. One of the main challenges is dealing with non-ideal conditions, such as friction and external forces, which can affect the motion of a rigid body. These factors can make it difficult to accurately predict the behavior of a system and may require additional considerations in the modeling process.



Another challenge is the complexity of the equations involved in plane-motion kinematics. As the number of degrees of freedom increases, the equations become more complex and may require advanced mathematical techniques to solve. This can make it challenging for engineers to accurately model and analyze systems with a large number of moving parts.



Furthermore, the assumptions made in plane-motion kinematics, such as rigid bodies and ideal conditions, may not always hold true in real-world scenarios. This can lead to discrepancies between the predicted and actual behavior of a system, making it important for engineers to carefully consider the limitations of plane-motion kinematics when applying it to real-world problems.



Despite these challenges, plane-motion kinematics remains a valuable tool in the field of dynamics and control, providing a framework for understanding and analyzing the motion of rigid bodies in a plane. By carefully considering the limitations and challenges, engineers can effectively use this concept to design and optimize various systems for a wide range of applications.





# Title: Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 12: Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 12.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



In the previous section, we discussed the kinematics of plane motion for rigid bodies. Now, we will delve into the dynamics of these systems and how they can be modeled and controlled.



#### 12.3a Understanding Plane-motion Dynamics



To understand the dynamics of plane motion, we must first define the concept of a rigid body. A rigid body is a body that maintains its shape and size, and all points in the body move in parallel planes. This means that the distance between any two points in the body remains constant throughout its motion.



The motion of a rigid body can be described by its translational and rotational motion. Translational motion refers to the movement of the body as a whole, while rotational motion refers to the rotation of the body about a fixed axis. In plane motion, both translational and rotational motion occur in a single plane.



To model the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we can use the principles of Newtonian mechanics. Newton's laws of motion state that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. This means that to change the motion of a rigid body, we must apply a force to it.



In addition to external forces, we must also consider internal forces within the rigid body. These internal forces, such as tension and compression, can affect the motion of the body and must be taken into account in our modeling.



One way to model the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion is through the use of free body diagrams. These diagrams show all the external and internal forces acting on the body and can help us analyze the motion and determine the equations of motion.



Another important aspect of modeling dynamics is understanding the concept of moments of inertia. Moments of inertia are a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion and are crucial in determining the rotational dynamics of a rigid body.



In the next section, we will explore the applications of plane-motion dynamics and how it can be used to analyze and control various systems.

Another important aspect of modeling dynamics is understanding the concept of moments of inertia. Moments of inertia are a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion and are crucial in determining the rotational dynamics of a rigid body. They are defined as the sum of the products of the mass of each particle in the body and the square of its distance from the axis of rotation. The moment of inertia is dependent on the shape and mass distribution of the body, and it can be calculated using integrals or tables for common shapes.



To fully model the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we must also consider the conservation of energy and momentum. These principles can be applied to the translational and rotational motion of the body, and they provide additional equations to solve for the motion of the body.



In summary, understanding the dynamics of plane motion for rigid bodies involves considering external and internal forces, using free body diagrams, and applying principles of Newtonian mechanics, moments of inertia, and conservation laws. By combining these concepts, we can accurately model and control the motion of rigid bodies in plane motion.

Moments of inertia are a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion and are dependent on the mass distribution and shape of the object. In plane motion, we must consider both the moment of inertia about the axis of rotation and the moment of inertia about the perpendicular axis.



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we must also consider the concept of torque. Torque is the rotational equivalent of force and is defined as the product of force and the distance from the axis of rotation. In plane motion, torque can be caused by both external forces and internal forces, such as friction.



#### 12.3b Modeling Plane-motion Dynamics



To model the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we can use the principles of Newtonian mechanics and the equations of motion. These equations describe the relationship between the forces acting on the body and its resulting motion.



For translational motion, we can use Newton's second law, which states that the sum of all external forces acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration. In plane motion, we must consider both the x and y components of this equation.



For rotational motion, we can use the principle of conservation of angular momentum, which states that the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted upon by an external torque. In plane motion, we must consider both the x and y components of this equation, as well as the moment of inertia and the angular acceleration.



To fully model the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we must also consider the concept of energy. In plane motion, we can use the principle of conservation of energy, which states that the total energy of a system remains constant. This can be useful in analyzing the motion of a rigid body and determining its final position and velocity.



#### 12.3c Challenges in Plane-motion Dynamics



While the principles and equations of motion provide a solid foundation for modeling the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, there are still challenges that must be addressed. One of the main challenges is accurately modeling the internal forces within the body, such as friction and deformation.



Another challenge is dealing with non-rigid bodies, which do not maintain their shape and size during motion. These bodies require more complex modeling techniques, such as finite element analysis, to accurately predict their motion.



In addition, the assumptions made in modeling, such as the rigid body assumption, may not always hold true in real-world scenarios. This can lead to errors in the predicted motion of the body.



Despite these challenges, the principles and equations of motion provide a strong foundation for understanding and modeling the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion. With further advancements in technology and modeling techniques, we can continue to improve our understanding and control of these systems.

### Subsection: 13.1b Key Concepts from 2.003



In this subsection, we will highlight some of the key concepts covered in 2.003 that are relevant to the study of two-degree-of-freedom systems.



#### Mass, Stiffness, and Damping



In 2.003, we learned that every physical system can be represented by a mathematical model that includes three main components: mass, stiffness, and damping. These components are essential in understanding the behavior of a system and how it responds to external forces.



Mass represents the inertia of a system and is typically denoted by the symbol $m$. Stiffness, denoted by $k$, represents the resistance of a system to deformation. Damping, denoted by $c$, represents the dissipation of energy in a system. These three components work together to determine the dynamic behavior of a system.



#### Equations of Motion



One of the key skills we learned in 2.003 was how to derive the equations of motion for different types of systems. These equations describe the motion of a system and are essential in analyzing its behavior. In two-degree-of-freedom systems, we will use these equations to understand the coupled motion of two masses.



#### Natural Frequency, Damping Ratio, and Resonance



In 2.003, we also studied the concepts of natural frequency, damping ratio, and resonance. These concepts are crucial in understanding the behavior of dynamic systems. Natural frequency, denoted by $\omega_n$, is the frequency at which a system will vibrate without any external forces. Damping ratio, denoted by $\zeta$, represents the amount of damping in a system and affects its response to external forces. Resonance occurs when the frequency of an external force matches the natural frequency of a system, resulting in large amplitude vibrations.



#### Stability and Response Analysis



Another important aspect of 2.003 was learning how to analyze the stability of a system and its response to different inputs. We learned about the different types of stability, such as stable, unstable, and marginally stable, and how to determine the stability of a system using the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. We also learned how to analyze the response of a system to different inputs, such as step, ramp, and sinusoidal inputs.



#### Control Techniques



Finally, in 2.003, we were introduced to control techniques for dynamic systems. We learned about open-loop and closed-loop control strategies and how feedback control can be used to improve the performance of a system. We also learned how to design controllers to achieve desired system performance, such as reducing settling time or overshoot.



In the next section, we will build upon these key concepts and apply them to the study of two-degree-of-freedom systems.

### Section: 13.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 13.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of modeling dynamics and control for single-degree-of-freedom systems. Now, we will extend our understanding to more complex systems with multiple degrees of freedom. In this section, we will focus on the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion.



#### 13.2a Overview of Plane-motion Kinematics



Plane-motion kinematics deals with the study of the motion of rigid bodies in a two-dimensional plane. This is an important concept in the field of dynamics and control as many real-world systems can be approximated as two-dimensional motion. In this subsection, we will review the key concepts and equations related to plane-motion kinematics.



First, let's define some important terms. A rigid body is a body that maintains its shape and size even when subjected to external forces. In plane motion, the body is constrained to move in a two-dimensional plane, meaning that all points on the body move in parallel planes. The motion of a rigid body can be described by its position, velocity, and acceleration.



To understand the motion of a rigid body, we need to define a reference frame. A reference frame is a coordinate system that is used to measure the position, velocity, and acceleration of a body. In plane-motion kinematics, we typically use a Cartesian coordinate system with two axes, x and y, to represent the two-dimensional plane.



Now, let's discuss the equations that govern the motion of a rigid body in plane motion. The position of a point on the body can be described by its x and y coordinates, denoted as x(t) and y(t), respectively. The velocity of the point can be calculated by taking the time derivative of its position, giving us the equations:



$$

v_x(t) = \frac{dx(t)}{dt}

$$



$$

v_y(t) = \frac{dy(t)}{dt}

$$



Similarly, the acceleration of the point can be calculated by taking the time derivative of its velocity, giving us the equations:



$$

a_x(t) = \frac{dv_x(t)}{dt}

$$



$$

a_y(t) = \frac{dv_y(t)}{dt}

$$



These equations can be extended to describe the motion of the entire rigid body by considering the position, velocity, and acceleration of multiple points on the body. By analyzing the motion of different points on the body, we can gain a better understanding of its overall motion.



In the next subsection, we will apply these concepts to the study of vibrations in two-degree-of-freedom systems. By understanding the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion, we will be able to model and analyze the behavior of these systems more effectively.



#### 13.2b Key Equations for Plane-motion Kinematics



To summarize, the key equations for plane-motion kinematics are:



- Position: x(t), y(t)

- Velocity: v_x(t) = dx(t)/dt, v_y(t) = dy(t)/dt

- Acceleration: a_x(t) = dv_x(t)/dt, a_y(t) = dv_y(t)/dt



These equations can be used to describe the motion of a rigid body in a two-dimensional plane. By analyzing the motion of different points on the body, we can gain a better understanding of its overall motion. In the next section, we will apply these concepts to the study of vibrations in two-degree-of-freedom systems.

## Chapter 13: Vibrations of Two-Degree-of-Freedom Systems:



### Section: 13.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 13.2c Challenges in Plane-motion Kinematics



In the previous subsection, we discussed the basics of plane-motion kinematics and its applications in various fields. However, as with any mathematical model, there are challenges that arise when applying plane-motion kinematics to real-world systems. In this subsection, we will explore some of these challenges and how engineers and scientists have addressed them.



#### 13.2c Challenges in Plane-motion Kinematics



One of the main challenges in plane-motion kinematics is dealing with non-rigid bodies. While the principles of plane-motion kinematics are based on the assumption of rigid bodies, many real-world systems involve deformable bodies. This can lead to inaccuracies in the model and affect the performance of the system. To address this challenge, engineers have developed more advanced models that take into account the deformations of the body, such as the finite element method.



Another challenge in plane-motion kinematics is dealing with non-ideal conditions. In real-world systems, there are often external forces and disturbances that can affect the motion of the body. These forces may not be accounted for in the model, leading to discrepancies between the predicted and actual motion. To overcome this challenge, engineers use control theory to design controllers that can compensate for these disturbances and ensure the desired motion of the body.



In some cases, the assumptions made in plane-motion kinematics may not hold true. For example, in systems with high speeds or large deformations, the assumption of small displacements may not be valid. In these cases, more advanced models, such as nonlinear dynamics, must be used to accurately predict the motion of the body.



Another challenge in plane-motion kinematics is dealing with uncertainty. In many real-world systems, there may be uncertainties in the parameters or initial conditions of the system. This can lead to errors in the model and affect the performance of the system. To address this challenge, engineers use robust control techniques that can handle uncertainties and ensure the stability and performance of the system.



Despite these challenges, plane-motion kinematics remains a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the motion of rigid bodies in a two-dimensional plane. By continuously improving and refining our models, we can overcome these challenges and continue to apply plane-motion kinematics in various fields, from robotics and factory automation to aerospace engineering and virtual reality.

### Section: 13.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 13.3a Understanding Plane-motion Dynamics



In the previous section, we discussed the kinematics of plane-motion for rigid bodies. Now, we will delve into the dynamics of these systems, which involves understanding the forces and torques that act on the body and how they affect its motion.



#### 13.3a Understanding Plane-motion Dynamics



To understand the dynamics of a rigid body in plane-motion, we must first define the forces and torques acting on the body. These can be divided into two categories: external forces and internal forces. External forces are those that act on the body from outside, such as gravity, friction, and applied forces. Internal forces, on the other hand, are those that arise within the body, such as tension, compression, and shear.



To model the dynamics of a rigid body, we use Newton's second law, which states that the sum of all external forces acting on the body is equal to its mass times its acceleration. This can be expressed mathematically as:



$$\sum \mathbf{F}_{ext} = m\mathbf{a}$$



where $\mathbf{F}_{ext}$ is the vector sum of all external forces, $m$ is the mass of the body, and $\mathbf{a}$ is its acceleration.



In addition to external forces, we must also consider the effects of torques on the body. Torques are rotational forces that cause the body to rotate about an axis. Similar to forces, we can express the sum of all external torques as:



$$\sum \mathbf{\tau}_{ext} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha}$$



where $\mathbf{\tau}_{ext}$ is the vector sum of all external torques, $I$ is the moment of inertia of the body, and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ is its angular acceleration.



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body in plane-motion, we must also consider the effects of internal forces and torques. These can be more complex to model, as they depend on the material properties and geometry of the body. However, by using principles of mechanics and solid mechanics, we can develop models that accurately capture the behavior of these internal forces and torques.



One of the main challenges in modeling the dynamics of rigid bodies is dealing with the complexity of real-world systems. As mentioned in the previous section, many systems involve non-rigid bodies, non-ideal conditions, and uncertainties. To overcome these challenges, engineers and scientists have developed advanced techniques such as finite element analysis, control theory, and nonlinear dynamics.



In conclusion, understanding the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane-motion is crucial for accurately predicting the behavior of real-world systems. By considering external and internal forces and torques, and utilizing advanced modeling techniques, we can develop models that accurately capture the complex dynamics of these systems.

## Chapter 13: Vibrations of Two-Degree-of-Freedom Systems:



### Section: 13.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 13.3b Applications of Plane-motion Dynamics



In the previous section, we discussed the dynamics of a rigid body in plane-motion and how external forces and torques affect its motion. Now, we will explore some applications of this concept in various fields.



#### 13.3b Applications of Plane-motion Dynamics



One of the most common applications of plane-motion dynamics is in the design and analysis of mechanical systems. By understanding the forces and torques acting on a rigid body, engineers can predict its motion and design systems that can withstand these forces.



For example, in the design of a car suspension system, engineers must consider the forces and torques acting on the wheels as the car moves over different terrains. By using the principles of plane-motion dynamics, they can design a suspension system that can absorb these forces and provide a smooth ride for the passengers.



Another application of plane-motion dynamics is in the field of robotics. By understanding the forces and torques acting on a robot arm, engineers can design control systems that can accurately move the arm to perform various tasks. This is especially important in industries such as manufacturing, where robots are used to perform repetitive and precise tasks.



In the field of aerospace engineering, plane-motion dynamics is crucial in the design and control of aircraft and spacecraft. By understanding the forces and torques acting on these vehicles, engineers can design control systems that can stabilize and maneuver them in flight.



Furthermore, plane-motion dynamics is also used in the study of biomechanics, where it is applied to understand the movement of the human body and design prosthetics and assistive devices.



In summary, the applications of plane-motion dynamics are vast and diverse, ranging from mechanical systems to robotics, aerospace engineering, and even the human body. By understanding the forces and torques acting on a rigid body, we can design and control systems that can perform various tasks and withstand external forces.

## Chapter 13: Vibrations of Two-Degree-of-Freedom Systems:



### Section: 13.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 13.3c Challenges in Plane-motion Dynamics



In the previous section, we discussed the dynamics of a rigid body in plane-motion and its applications in various fields. However, there are also some challenges that arise when dealing with plane-motion dynamics.



#### 13.3c Challenges in Plane-motion Dynamics



One of the main challenges in plane-motion dynamics is accurately modeling the complex interactions between multiple bodies. In real-world systems, there are often multiple rigid bodies interacting with each other, and the forces and torques between them can be difficult to predict. This is especially true in systems with flexible bodies, where the dynamics become even more complex.



Another challenge is dealing with non-conservative forces, such as friction and air resistance. These forces can significantly affect the motion of a rigid body and must be carefully considered in the modeling process. In some cases, these forces may even cause instability or unexpected behavior in the system.



Additionally, the assumptions made in the modeling process can also pose challenges. For example, the assumption of rigid bodies may not hold true in all cases, and the effects of deformation and flexibility must be taken into account. Similarly, the assumption of small angles in the equations of motion may not be valid for large amplitude vibrations.



Furthermore, the accuracy of the results obtained from plane-motion dynamics is highly dependent on the accuracy of the initial conditions and parameters used in the model. Small errors in these values can lead to significant discrepancies in the predicted motion of the system.



In summary, while plane-motion dynamics is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the motion of rigid bodies, it also presents several challenges that must be carefully considered and addressed in order to obtain accurate results.

## Chapter 14: Control of Systems with Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 14.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 14.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of modeling and controlling systems with rigid bodies. Now, we will dive deeper into the topic by exploring the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion. This is an important aspect of understanding the behavior of rigid bodies and is essential for designing effective control strategies.



#### Kinematic width



Before we delve into the specifics of plane-motion kinematics, let's first define the concept of kinematic width. This term refers to the extent of a moving set of points in a given space. In the context of rigid bodies, it represents the range of motion of the body in a particular direction. Understanding the kinematic width is crucial for analyzing the dynamics and designing control systems for rigid bodies.



#### Plane-motion kinematics



Now, let's focus on the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion. This refers to the study of the motion of rigid bodies in a two-dimensional plane. In this case, the body is constrained to move in a single plane, making the analysis and control of its motion more manageable.



The kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion can be described using various formalisms, such as rotation formalisms and conversion from axis-angle. These provide mathematical representations of the body's motion and are useful for analyzing and designing control systems.



#### Rotation formalisms in three dimensions



One of the most commonly used rotation formalisms is the axis-angle representation. This involves representing the rotation of a rigid body in three dimensions using an axis and an angle. The axis is defined by a vector, while the angle represents the amount of rotation around that axis.



Another commonly used rotation formalism is the extended Kalman filter. This is a mathematical model used for state estimation in continuous-time systems. It involves predicting and updating the state of a system based on measurements and a given model.



#### Conversion from axis-angle



The conversion from axis-angle is a useful tool for transforming between different rotation formalisms. It involves converting the axis and angle representation to other forms, such as Euler angles or quaternions. This allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the rigid body's motion and can aid in the design of control systems.



#### Extended Kalman filter



The extended Kalman filter is a powerful tool for state estimation in continuous-time systems. It involves predicting and updating the state of a system based on measurements and a given model. This is particularly useful for controlling systems with rigid bodies, as it allows for real-time adjustments to be made based on measured data.



#### Generalizations



The extended Kalman filter can also be extended to handle more complex systems, such as continuous-time systems with discrete-time measurements. This is known as the continuous-time extended Kalman filter and involves predicting and updating the state of a system based on both continuous-time and discrete-time data.



#### Discrete-time measurements



In many real-world applications, measurements are taken at discrete intervals, even though the system itself is continuous-time. In these cases, the discrete-time extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the state of the system. This involves predicting and updating the state based on both continuous-time and discrete-time measurements, making it a more accurate and robust approach.



In conclusion, understanding the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion is crucial for designing effective control strategies. By using various rotation formalisms and tools like the extended Kalman filter, we can accurately model and control the motion of rigid bodies in real-time. In the next section, we will explore the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion and how they can be controlled.

## Chapter 14: Control of Systems with Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 14.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 14.2c Challenges in Plane-motion Kinematics



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of plane-motion kinematics for rigid bodies and explored some of its applications in control systems. However, as with any mathematical concept, there are challenges that arise when applying it to real-world systems. In this subsection, we will discuss some of the challenges that engineers face when dealing with plane-motion kinematics.



#### Dealing with non-ideal conditions



One of the main challenges in applying plane-motion kinematics to real-world systems is dealing with non-ideal conditions. In theory, rigid bodies are assumed to have no deformations or flexibility, but in reality, this is not the case. In addition, external forces and disturbances can also affect the motion of a rigid body, making it difficult to accurately model and control. Engineers must take these factors into account and find ways to mitigate their effects in order to achieve desired performance.



#### Complexity in multi-body systems



Another challenge arises when dealing with multi-body systems, where multiple rigid bodies are connected and interact with each other. In such systems, the kinematics become more complex and difficult to model, especially when considering the effects of external forces and disturbances. This complexity increases even further when trying to design control strategies for these systems.



#### Non-linearities and uncertainties



Plane-motion kinematics is based on linear transformations and assumes that the motion of a rigid body is smooth and predictable. However, in real-world systems, non-linearities and uncertainties can arise, making the motion of a rigid body more complex and difficult to model. This can lead to errors in control strategies and affect the overall performance of the system.



#### Computational challenges



As with any mathematical concept, implementing plane-motion kinematics in real-world systems can also pose computational challenges. The calculations involved can be complex and time-consuming, especially when dealing with multi-body systems. Engineers must find efficient ways to implement these calculations in order to achieve real-time control of the system.



In conclusion, while plane-motion kinematics is a powerful tool for modeling and controlling systems with rigid bodies, it also presents several challenges that engineers must overcome in order to achieve desired performance.

# Title: Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 14: Control of Systems with Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 14.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 14.3a Understanding Plane-motion Dynamics



In the previous section, we discussed the kinematics of rigid bodies in plane motion and explored its applications in control systems. Now, we will delve into the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion, which is essential for understanding and designing control strategies for these systems.



#### The dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion



The dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion is governed by Newton's laws of motion. These laws state that the net force acting on a body is equal to its mass times its acceleration, and the net torque acting on a body is equal to its moment of inertia times its angular acceleration. In other words, the motion of a rigid body is determined by the forces and torques acting on it.



#### Equations of motion



To fully understand the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we need to derive the equations of motion. This can be done by applying Newton's laws of motion to the body and considering the external forces and torques acting on it. The resulting equations are known as the Euler-Lagrange equations and are given by:



$$

\sum F_x = m\ddot{x} \\

\sum F_y = m\ddot{y} \\

\sum M = I\ddot{\theta}

$$



where $m$ is the mass of the body, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $\ddot{x}$, $\ddot{y}$, and $\ddot{\theta}$ are the linear and angular accelerations, respectively.



#### Challenges in modeling plane-motion dynamics



Similar to the challenges faced in modeling plane-motion kinematics, there are also challenges in modeling the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion. These include dealing with non-ideal conditions, complexity in multi-body systems, and non-linearities and uncertainties.



#### Dealing with non-ideal conditions



As mentioned earlier, rigid bodies in theory are assumed to have no deformations or flexibility. However, in reality, this is not the case. External forces and disturbances can also affect the motion of a rigid body, making it difficult to accurately model and control. Engineers must take these factors into account and find ways to mitigate their effects in order to achieve desired performance.



#### Complexity in multi-body systems



In multi-body systems, where multiple rigid bodies are connected and interact with each other, the dynamics become more complex and difficult to model. This is because the motion of one body can affect the motion of another, and the external forces and disturbances can also have a cascading effect on the entire system. Designing control strategies for these systems requires a thorough understanding of the dynamics and careful consideration of all the interacting bodies.



#### Non-linearities and uncertainties



Similar to the challenges faced in modeling plane-motion kinematics, non-linearities and uncertainties can also arise in the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion. These can lead to errors in control strategies and affect the overall performance of the system. Engineers must account for these factors and design robust control strategies that can handle these uncertainties.



In the next section, we will explore some control strategies for systems with rigid bodies in plane motion and see how these challenges can be addressed in practice.





# Title: Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 14: Control of Systems with Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 14.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 14.3b Applications of Plane-motion Dynamics



In the previous section, we discussed the equations of motion for rigid bodies in plane motion and the challenges in modeling their dynamics. Now, we will explore some applications of these dynamics in control systems.



#### Stability analysis



One of the main applications of plane-motion dynamics is in stability analysis of control systems. By understanding the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we can analyze the stability of a control system and determine if it will converge to a desired state or oscillate around it. This is crucial in designing control strategies that ensure stable and accurate performance of a system.



#### Trajectory planning



Another important application of plane-motion dynamics is in trajectory planning. By considering the equations of motion and the external forces and torques acting on a rigid body, we can plan and control its trajectory to achieve a desired path or motion. This is particularly useful in robotics and autonomous systems, where precise and efficient trajectory planning is essential.



#### Control design



The dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion also play a crucial role in control design. By understanding the forces and torques acting on a body, we can design control strategies that manipulate these forces and torques to achieve a desired motion or behavior. This is especially important in systems with multiple rigid bodies, where the dynamics of each body must be considered in the overall control design.



#### Real-world applications



The applications of plane-motion dynamics are not limited to theoretical control systems. They have real-world applications in various fields, such as aerospace, robotics, and manufacturing. For example, the dynamics of a spacecraft in orbit can be modeled using plane-motion dynamics to plan and control its trajectory. In manufacturing, the dynamics of a robotic arm can be analyzed to design control strategies for precise and efficient movement.



#### Conclusion



In this section, we have explored some of the applications of plane-motion dynamics in control systems. By understanding the equations of motion and the challenges in modeling these dynamics, we can design effective control strategies for a wide range of systems. These applications highlight the importance of studying and understanding the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion in the field of control systems.





# Title: Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 14: Control of Systems with Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 14.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 14.3c Challenges in Plane-motion Dynamics



In the previous section, we discussed the equations of motion for rigid bodies in plane motion and their applications in control systems. However, there are still some challenges in accurately modeling the dynamics of these systems. In this subsection, we will explore some of these challenges and how they can be addressed.



#### Nonlinear dynamics



One of the main challenges in modeling the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion is the nonlinearity of the equations of motion. Unlike linear systems, where the input-output relationship is directly proportional, the dynamics of rigid bodies involve nonlinear relationships between the inputs (forces and torques) and the outputs (motion and orientation). This nonlinearity can make it difficult to analyze and control the system, as it may exhibit complex and unpredictable behavior.



To address this challenge, various techniques such as linearization and feedback control can be used. Linearization involves approximating the nonlinear equations of motion with linear equations, making it easier to analyze and control the system. Feedback control, on the other hand, uses information about the current state of the system to adjust the inputs and achieve a desired output. These techniques can help mitigate the effects of nonlinearity in rigid body dynamics.



#### Coupled dynamics



Another challenge in modeling rigid body dynamics is the coupling between different degrees of freedom. In plane motion, a rigid body can move and rotate in two dimensions, and these motions are coupled together. For example, a force applied in one direction may cause both translational and rotational motion. This coupling can make it difficult to analyze and control the system, as the dynamics of one degree of freedom can affect the others.



To address this challenge, techniques such as decoupling and state-space control can be used. Decoupling involves separating the coupled dynamics into individual components, making it easier to analyze and control each degree of freedom separately. State-space control, on the other hand, uses a mathematical representation of the system's dynamics to design control strategies that can account for the coupling between different degrees of freedom.



#### Modeling uncertainties



In real-world applications, there are often uncertainties in the parameters and dynamics of rigid bodies. These uncertainties can arise from manufacturing tolerances, external disturbances, or modeling errors. They can significantly affect the performance of control systems, as the actual dynamics may differ from the modeled dynamics.



To address this challenge, techniques such as robust control and adaptive control can be used. Robust control designs controllers that can handle uncertainties and disturbances, ensuring stable and accurate performance of the system. Adaptive control, on the other hand, uses online learning algorithms to adjust the control strategy based on the observed dynamics, making it more robust to uncertainties.



#### Real-time implementation



Finally, a major challenge in implementing control systems for rigid bodies in plane motion is the real-time computation and control. As these systems often involve complex dynamics and require fast and accurate control, it can be challenging to implement them in real-time.



To address this challenge, techniques such as parallel computing and hardware acceleration can be used. Parallel computing involves using multiple processors to perform computations in parallel, reducing the computation time. Hardware acceleration, on the other hand, uses specialized hardware such as GPUs to perform computations faster and more efficiently.



In conclusion, while the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion have various applications in control systems, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. By using appropriate techniques and strategies, we can overcome these challenges and design effective control systems for a wide range of real-world applications.

## Chapter: Modeling Dynamics and Control II



### Introduction



In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of uniaxial motion, which is the motion of an object along a single axis. This type of motion is commonly seen in various mechanical systems such as robots, vehicles, and industrial machinery. Understanding and modeling uniaxial motion is crucial in the field of dynamics and control as it allows us to accurately predict and control the behavior of these systems.



We will begin by discussing the fundamental principles of uniaxial motion, including displacement, velocity, and acceleration. These concepts will be further explored through the use of mathematical equations and diagrams. We will also cover the different types of uniaxial motion, such as constant velocity, constant acceleration, and harmonic motion.



Next, we will move on to the topic of modeling uniaxial motion. This involves using mathematical models to represent the behavior of a system in motion. We will explore various modeling techniques, including differential equations, transfer functions, and state-space models. These models will allow us to analyze and predict the behavior of a system under different conditions.



Finally, we will discuss the control of uniaxial motion. This involves using control systems to manipulate the behavior of a system in motion. We will cover different control strategies, such as open-loop and closed-loop control, and how they can be applied to uniaxial motion systems. We will also explore the use of feedback control to improve the performance and stability of a system.



Overall, this chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of uniaxial motion and its applications in dynamics and control. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in modeling and controlling uniaxial motion systems, which can be applied to various real-world scenarios. 





# Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 15: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 15.1 Fixed-axis Rotation:



### Subsection (optional): 15.1a Introduction to Fixed-axis Rotation



In the previous chapter, we discussed the principles of rotation in three dimensions and various formalisms used to represent it. In this section, we will focus on a specific type of rotation known as fixed-axis rotation.



Fixed-axis rotation, also known as Euler rotation, is a type of rotation where an object rotates around a fixed axis. This type of rotation is commonly seen in mechanical systems, such as rotating machinery and vehicles. Understanding and modeling fixed-axis rotation is essential in the field of dynamics and control as it allows us to accurately predict and control the behavior of these systems.



To begin, let us consider an object rotating around a fixed axis, denoted by <math>{a} = [{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>. This axis is normalized, meaning its magnitude is equal to 1. We can represent the rotation of this object using the axis-angle formalism, where the angle of rotation is denoted by <math>{\theta}</math>. This formalism is useful in visualizing the rotation of an object in three dimensions, as it allows us to represent the rotation as a vector on a unit sphere known as Poinsot's ellipsoid.



One of the applications of Poinsot's construction is in visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. By representing the rotation of the spacecraft using the axis-angle formalism, we can easily visualize its orientation and predict its behavior in space.



Now, let us move on to the mathematical representation of fixed-axis rotation. To compute the rotation matrix for a given input <math>{Q}=[{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>, we can use the following equation:



$$

R = \begin{bmatrix}

1 - 2 q_j^2 - 2 q_k^2 & 2(q_i q_j - q_k q_r) & 2(q_i q_k + q_j q_r)\\

2(q_i q_j + q_k q_r) & 1 - 2 q_i^2 - 2q_k^2 & 2(q_j q_k - q_i q_r)\\

2(q_i q_k - q_j q_r) & 2(q_j q_k + q_i q_r) & 1 - 2 q_i^2 - 2 q_j^2

\end{bmatrix}

$$



Alternatively, we can use the following equation to compute the rotation matrix:



$$

R = \begin{bmatrix}

\cos \theta+x^2 (1-\cos \theta) & xy(1-\cos \theta) - z\sin \theta & y\sin \theta + xz(1-\cos \theta) \\

xz(1-\cos \theta) - y\sin \theta & x\sin \theta + yz(1-\cos \theta) & \cos \theta+z^{2}(1-\cos \theta)

\end{bmatrix}

$$



where <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math> are the components of the input vector <math>{A} = [X, Y ,Z]</math>, and <math>\theta = \|A\|</math>.



Now, let us consider the rotation of a vector <math>v = (X, Y, Z)</math> around the rotation vector <math>Q = (X,Y,Z)</math>. The angle of rotation will be <math> {\theta} = {\|Q\|} </math>. We can use the following equation to rotate the vector:



$$

v' = Rv = (\cos \theta)v + (\sin \theta)(Q \times v) + (1 - \cos \theta)(Q \cdot v)Q

$$



where <math>R</math> is the rotation matrix computed using the equations mentioned above.



In summary, fixed-axis rotation is a type of rotation commonly seen in mechanical systems. It can be represented using the axis-angle formalism and can be computed using various mathematical equations. Understanding and modeling fixed-axis rotation is crucial in the field of dynamics and control, as it allows us to accurately predict and control the behavior of systems in motion.

## Chapter 15: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 15.1 Fixed-axis Rotation:



### Subsection (optional): 15.1b Applications of Fixed-axis Rotation



In the previous section, we discussed the principles and mathematical representation of fixed-axis rotation. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of this type of rotation in the field of dynamics and control.



One of the most common applications of fixed-axis rotation is in the field of robotics. Many robotic systems, such as robotic arms and manipulators, use fixed-axis rotation to move and manipulate objects in three-dimensional space. By accurately modeling and controlling the rotation of these systems, we can ensure precise and efficient movement.



Another application of fixed-axis rotation is in the field of aerospace engineering. Spacecraft and satellites often use fixed-axis rotation to orient themselves in space and control their movements. By understanding and modeling the rotation of these systems, we can predict their behavior and ensure their successful operation.



Fixed-axis rotation is also commonly used in the design and control of vehicles, such as cars, airplanes, and ships. By accurately modeling the rotation of these vehicles, we can predict their movements and ensure their stability and safety.



In addition to these practical applications, fixed-axis rotation also has applications in various mathematical and computational techniques. For example, the conversion from axis-angle to other rotation formalisms, such as quaternions and Euler angles, often involves fixed-axis rotation calculations. This is also true for techniques such as line integral convolution, which is used in image processing and computer graphics.



Furthermore, fixed-axis rotation is used in the computation of basis matrices, which are essential in many mathematical and computational applications. These matrices are used to transform vectors and coordinates between different coordinate systems, making them a crucial tool in many fields, including dynamics and control.

Its mathematical representation and principles are also essential in many mathematical and computational techniques. By understanding and accurately modeling fixed-axis rotation, we can improve the design and control of various systems and advance our understanding of dynamics and control.





# Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 15: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 15.1 Fixed-axis Rotation:



### Subsection (optional): 15.1c Challenges in Fixed-axis Rotation



In the previous section, we discussed the principles and mathematical representation of fixed-axis rotation. However, despite its widespread use and applications, fixed-axis rotation also presents some challenges that must be addressed in order to accurately model and control systems that involve this type of rotation.



One of the main challenges in fixed-axis rotation is dealing with singularities. Singularities occur when the rotation axis aligns with one of the coordinate axes, resulting in a division by zero in the rotation matrix. This can lead to numerical instability and errors in the calculations. To overcome this challenge, various techniques have been developed, such as using alternate basis calculations or using quaternions instead of rotation matrices.



Another challenge in fixed-axis rotation is dealing with non-constant rotation rates. In many real-world systems, the rotation rate is not constant and may vary over time. This can make it difficult to accurately model and control the system, as the equations and assumptions used for constant rotation rates may no longer apply. To address this challenge, advanced techniques such as Kalman filtering and adaptive control can be used to estimate and compensate for the varying rotation rates.



Furthermore, fixed-axis rotation can also present challenges in terms of computational efficiency. As the number of degrees of freedom and the complexity of the system increase, the computational cost of modeling and controlling fixed-axis rotation also increases. This can be a significant challenge in real-time applications, where fast and accurate calculations are crucial. To overcome this challenge, various optimization techniques and parallel computing methods can be employed.



In addition to these challenges, fixed-axis rotation also has limitations in terms of its applicability. This type of rotation is only suitable for systems with a single rotation axis, and cannot accurately model more complex rotations, such as those involving multiple axes or non-rigid bodies. In such cases, more advanced rotation formalisms, such as Euler angles or quaternions, may be more suitable.



Despite these challenges and limitations, fixed-axis rotation remains a fundamental and widely used concept in the field of dynamics and control. By understanding and addressing these challenges, we can effectively model and control systems that involve fixed-axis rotation, and continue to advance our understanding and application of this important concept.

### Section: 15.2 First and Second Order Systems:



### Subsection (optional): 15.2a Understanding First Order Systems



In the previous section, we discussed the principles and mathematical representation of fixed-axis rotation. However, in many real-world systems, the motion is not limited to a single axis and may involve multiple degrees of freedom. In such cases, it becomes necessary to model and control the system using first and second order systems.



First order systems are characterized by a single differential equation, which relates the output variable to the input variable and its derivative. These systems are commonly used to model physical systems such as mass-spring-damper systems, electrical circuits, and chemical reactions. The behavior of first order systems can be analyzed using techniques such as Laplace transforms and transfer functions.



Second order systems, on the other hand, are characterized by two differential equations, which relate the output variable to the input variable and its first and second derivatives. These systems are commonly used to model more complex physical systems such as mechanical systems with multiple degrees of freedom, electrical circuits with energy storage elements, and control systems. The behavior of second order systems can be analyzed using techniques such as state-space representation and frequency response analysis.



Understanding first and second order systems is crucial for modeling and controlling complex systems involving uniaxial motion. By accurately representing the dynamics of the system using these models, engineers and scientists can design effective control strategies to achieve desired performance and stability.



However, as with fixed-axis rotation, there are also challenges in modeling and controlling first and second order systems. One of the main challenges is dealing with nonlinearities. In many real-world systems, the relationship between the input and output variables is not linear, which can make it difficult to accurately model and control the system. To address this challenge, advanced techniques such as feedback linearization and adaptive control can be used.



Another challenge is dealing with uncertainties and disturbances. In real-world systems, there are often external factors that can affect the behavior of the system, such as noise, disturbances, and uncertainties in the parameters. These factors can lead to errors in the model and affect the performance of the control system. To overcome this challenge, robust control techniques and estimation methods can be used to account for these uncertainties.



In addition to these challenges, first and second order systems also require careful consideration of the system's stability and performance. The choice of control strategy and parameters can greatly impact the stability and performance of the system. Therefore, it is important to carefully analyze and design the control system to ensure stability and achieve desired performance.



In conclusion, first and second order systems are essential tools for modeling and controlling uniaxial motion in complex systems. By understanding the principles and challenges of these systems, engineers and scientists can effectively design and implement control strategies to achieve desired performance and stability.

### Section: 15.2 First and Second Order Systems:



### Subsection (optional): 15.2b Understanding Second Order Systems



In the previous section, we discussed the principles and mathematical representation of first order systems. However, many real-world systems involve more complex dynamics that cannot be accurately represented by a single differential equation. In such cases, second order systems are used to model the behavior of the system.



Second order systems are characterized by two differential equations, which relate the output variable to the input variable and its first and second derivatives. These systems are commonly used to model mechanical systems with multiple degrees of freedom, electrical circuits with energy storage elements, and control systems. The behavior of second order systems can be analyzed using techniques such as state-space representation and frequency response analysis.



One of the key advantages of using second order systems is their ability to accurately capture nonlinearities in the system. Nonlinearities can arise from various sources such as friction, saturation, and hysteresis, and can significantly affect the behavior of the system. By using second order models, engineers and scientists can better understand and control these nonlinearities, leading to improved system performance.



However, modeling and controlling second order systems also present challenges. One of the main challenges is dealing with uncertainties in the system parameters. In many real-world systems, the parameters may not be known exactly, and this can lead to errors in the model and control design. To address this issue, techniques such as adaptive control and robust control are used to account for uncertainties and ensure robust performance of the system.



Understanding second order systems is crucial for accurately modeling and controlling complex systems involving uniaxial motion. By utilizing the appropriate techniques and accounting for nonlinearities and uncertainties, engineers and scientists can design effective control strategies to achieve desired performance and stability.

Nonlinearities can arise from various sources such as friction, saturation, and hysteresis, and can significantly affect the behavior of the system. By using second order models, engineers and scientists can better understand and control these nonlinearities, leading to improved system performance.



However, modeling and controlling second order systems also present challenges. One of the main challenges is dealing with uncertainties in the system parameters. In many real-world systems, the parameters may not be known exactly, and this can lead to errors in the model and control design. To address this issue, techniques such as adaptive control and robust control are used to account for uncertainties and ensure robust performance of the system.



In comparison to first order systems, second order systems offer a more accurate representation of real-world systems. While first order systems only consider the input and output variables, second order systems also take into account the system's dynamics and nonlinearities. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior and better control over its performance.



Another advantage of second order systems is their ability to handle multiple inputs and outputs. First order systems are limited to a single input and output, but second order systems can handle multiple inputs and outputs, making them more suitable for complex systems with multiple degrees of freedom.



However, the increased complexity of second order systems also means that they require more computational resources and may be more difficult to analyze and control. This is especially true when dealing with uncertainties in the system parameters. In contrast, first order systems are simpler and easier to analyze and control, but they may not accurately capture the behavior of more complex systems.



In conclusion, second order systems offer a more accurate and comprehensive representation of real-world systems, but they also come with their own set of challenges. Engineers and scientists must carefully consider the trade-offs between accuracy and complexity when choosing between first and second order systems for modeling and controlling uniaxial motion.

### Section: 15.3 Natural and Forced Response:



### Subsection (optional): 15.3a Understanding Natural Response



In the previous section, we discussed the principles and mathematical representation of first and second order systems. These systems are commonly used to model the behavior of real-world systems, such as mechanical systems, electrical circuits, and control systems. However, in order to fully understand the behavior of these systems, it is important to consider both the natural and forced response.



The natural response of a system refers to its behavior without any external input or disturbance. It is solely determined by the system's initial conditions and its inherent dynamics. In other words, it is the response of the system when left to its own devices. The natural response can be represented mathematically using the system's transfer function, which relates the output variable to the initial conditions and the system's dynamics.



On the other hand, the forced response of a system refers to its behavior when subjected to an external input or disturbance. This input can be in the form of a force, voltage, or any other type of signal. The forced response is determined by both the system's dynamics and the characteristics of the input signal. It can also be represented mathematically using the system's transfer function, but with the input signal as an additional variable.



Understanding the natural and forced response of a system is crucial in the design and control of real-world systems. By analyzing the natural response, engineers and scientists can gain insight into the inherent behavior of the system and identify any potential issues or limitations. The forced response, on the other hand, allows for the prediction and control of the system's behavior under different input conditions.



In the next section, we will discuss the different methods for analyzing and modeling the natural and forced response of a system. This will include techniques such as time-domain analysis, frequency-domain analysis, and state-space representation. By understanding these methods, we can gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of real-world systems and effectively design and control them.

### Section: 15.3 Natural and Forced Response:



### Subsection (optional): 15.3b Understanding Forced Response



In the previous section, we discussed the natural response of a system, which is solely determined by the system's initial conditions and its inherent dynamics. However, in real-world systems, external inputs or disturbances are often present, which can significantly affect the system's behavior. In this section, we will focus on understanding the forced response of a system and its importance in the analysis and control of real-world systems.



The forced response of a system refers to its behavior when subjected to an external input or disturbance. This input can be in the form of a force, voltage, or any other type of signal. The forced response is determined by both the system's dynamics and the characteristics of the input signal. It can be represented mathematically using the system's transfer function, but with the input signal as an additional variable.



To better understand the forced response, let's consider an example of a mechanical system with a mass attached to a spring. The natural response of this system would be the oscillation of the mass due to the spring's stiffness and the mass's inertia. However, if an external force is applied to the mass, the system's behavior will be affected, resulting in a forced response. The characteristics of the external force, such as its magnitude, frequency, and duration, will determine the behavior of the system.



In order to analyze and model the forced response of a system, engineers and scientists use various techniques such as frequency response analysis, time-domain analysis, and transfer function analysis. These methods allow for the prediction and control of the system's behavior under different input conditions. By understanding the forced response, engineers can design and optimize systems to perform specific tasks and meet desired performance criteria.



In summary, the forced response of a system is crucial in the analysis and control of real-world systems. It allows for the prediction and control of the system's behavior under different input conditions, which is essential in the design and optimization of systems. In the next section, we will discuss the different methods for analyzing and modeling the forced response of a system in more detail.

## Chapter 15: Uniaxial Motion:



### Section: 15.3 Natural and Forced Response:



### Subsection (optional): 15.3c Comparing Natural and Forced Response



In the previous section, we discussed the natural and forced response of a system. While the natural response is solely determined by the system's initial conditions and inherent dynamics, the forced response is influenced by external inputs or disturbances. In this section, we will compare and contrast the natural and forced response and discuss their significance in the analysis and control of systems.



The natural response of a system is often referred to as its free response, as it is the system's behavior without any external influences. It is determined by the system's initial conditions and its inherent dynamics, which can be represented mathematically using the system's transfer function. The natural response is important in understanding the stability and behavior of a system in the absence of external inputs.



On the other hand, the forced response of a system is its behavior when subjected to an external input or disturbance. This input can be in the form of a force, voltage, or any other type of signal. The forced response is determined by both the system's dynamics and the characteristics of the input signal. It can also be represented mathematically using the system's transfer function, but with the input signal as an additional variable.



One key difference between the natural and forced response is that the natural response is a transient behavior, while the forced response is a steady-state behavior. The natural response decays over time, while the forced response remains constant as long as the external input is present. This is because the external input continuously drives the system, preventing it from returning to its initial state.



In terms of analysis and control, the natural response is important in understanding the system's stability and behavior in the absence of external inputs. It allows engineers to predict how the system will behave over time and make necessary adjustments to ensure its stability. On the other hand, the forced response is crucial in designing and optimizing systems to perform specific tasks and meet desired performance criteria. By understanding the forced response, engineers can determine the system's behavior under different input conditions and make necessary adjustments to achieve the desired response.



In conclusion, the natural and forced response are two important aspects of a system's behavior. While the natural response is solely determined by the system's initial conditions and inherent dynamics, the forced response is influenced by external inputs. Both responses play a crucial role in the analysis and control of systems and must be considered in the design and optimization process.

## Chapter: Modeling Dynamics and Control II



### Introduction:



In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of modeling dynamics and control, including the use of differential equations and transfer functions. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic by exploring impulse response. Impulse response is a fundamental concept in the field of control engineering, and it plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of dynamic systems.



The impulse response of a system is the output of the system when an impulse input is applied. An impulse input is a short burst of energy that has an infinitely small duration and an infinitely large amplitude. In practical terms, an impulse input can be approximated by a very short and intense pulse. The response of a system to an impulse input is a characteristic of the system and can provide valuable insights into its behavior.



In this chapter, we will discuss the mathematical representation of impulse response and how it can be used to analyze and design control systems. We will also explore the concept of convolution, which is a mathematical operation used to calculate the response of a system to any input signal. Additionally, we will cover the concept of transfer functions and how they can be used to represent the impulse response of a system.



Overall, this chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of impulse response and its applications in modeling dynamics and control. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in this important topic and will be able to apply it to various real-world control problems. 





## Chapter 16: Impulse Response:



### Section: 16.1 Collisions:



In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of modeling dynamics and control, including the use of differential equations and transfer functions. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic by exploring impulse response. Impulse response is a fundamental concept in the field of control engineering, and it plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of dynamic systems.



### Subsection: 16.1a Introduction to Collisions



Collisions are a common occurrence in the physical world, and they play a significant role in many engineering applications. In this section, we will discuss the basics of collisions and how they can be modeled using impulse response.



#### Elastic Collision



An elastic collision is a type of collision where the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved. In other words, the total energy before the collision is equal to the total energy after the collision. This type of collision is often seen in billiards, where the balls bounce off each other without losing any energy.



To model an elastic collision, we can use the equations derived from the conservation of momentum and energy. These equations take into account the masses and velocities of the objects involved in the collision, as well as the contact angle between them.



#### Two-dimensional Collision with Two Moving Objects



In a two-dimensional collision with two moving objects, the final velocities of the objects can be calculated using the following equations:



$$

v'_{1x} = \frac{v_{1}\cos(\theta_1-\varphi)(m_1-m_2)+2m_2v_{2}\cos(\theta_2-\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}\cos(\varphi)+v_{1}\sin(\theta_1-\varphi)\cos(\varphi + \tfrac{\pi}{2})

\\[0.8em]

v'_{1y} = \frac{v_{1}\cos(\theta_1-\varphi)(m_1-m_2)+2m_2v_{2}\cos(\theta_2-\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}\sin(\varphi)+v_{1}\sin(\theta_1-\varphi)\sin(\varphi + \tfrac{\pi}{2})

$$



where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the scalar sizes of the two original speeds of the objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are their masses, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are their movement angles. The lowercase phi ($\varphi$) represents the contact angle between the objects.



#### Other Conserved Quantities



In addition to momentum and energy, there are other conserved quantities that can be used to model collisions. These include angular momentum and linear momentum in different directions. By taking into account these conserved quantities, we can create a more accurate model of a collision.



### Conclusion



In this section, we have introduced the concept of collisions and how they can be modeled using impulse response. We have also discussed the equations used to calculate the final velocities of objects involved in a collision. In the next section, we will explore the concept of impulse response in more detail and its applications in modeling dynamics and control.

\\[0.8em]

v'_{1y} = \frac{v_{1}\cos(\theta_1-\varphi)(m_1-m_2)+2m_2v_{2}\cos(\theta_2-\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}\sin(\varphi)+v_{1}\sin(\theta_1-\varphi)\sin(\varphi + \tfrac{\pi}{2})

$$



where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the scalar sizes of the two original speeds of the objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are their masses, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are their movement angles. The contact angle between the objects is denoted by $\varphi$. These equations can be derived from the fact that the interaction between the two bodies is easily calculated along the contact angle. By rotating the x and y axis to be parallel with the contact angle, the velocities of the objects can be calculated in one dimension. They can then be rotated back to the original orientation to get the true x and y components of the velocities.



In an angle-free representation, the changed velocities are computed using the centers and at the time of contact as:



$$

\mathbf{v}'_1 = \mathbf{v}_1-\frac{2 m_2}{m_1+m_2} \ \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}_1-\mathbf{v}_2,\,\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2\rangle}{\|\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2\|^2} \ (\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2),

\\[0.8em]

\mathbf{v}'_2 = \mathbf{v}_2-\frac{2 m_1}{m_1+m_2} \ \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}_2-\mathbf{v}_1,\,\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1\rangle}{\|\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1\|^2} \ (\mathbf{x}_2-\mathbf{x}_1)

$$



where the angle brackets indicate the inner product (or dot product) of two vectors. These equations take into account the masses and velocities of the objects, as well as their positions at the time of contact.



### Subsection: 16.1b Physics of Collisions



In the previous subsection, we discussed the basics of elastic collisions and how they can be modeled using impulse response. In this subsection, we will delve deeper into the physics behind collisions and explore other conserved quantities.



#### Inelastic Collision



In contrast to elastic collisions, inelastic collisions are those in which the total kinetic energy of the system is not conserved. This means that some of the energy is lost during the collision, usually in the form of heat or sound. Inelastic collisions are commonly seen in everyday situations, such as when a car collides with a wall or when a ball bounces on the ground.



To model an inelastic collision, we can use the equations derived from the conservation of momentum and energy, similar to those used for elastic collisions. However, in this case, we also need to take into account the loss of energy during the collision.



#### Other Conserved Quantities



In addition to momentum and energy, there are other quantities that are conserved during collisions. These include angular momentum, linear momentum in different directions, and kinetic energy in different directions. These conserved quantities can be used to model more complex collisions, such as those involving multiple objects or collisions in three dimensions.



Understanding the physics behind collisions and the conserved quantities involved is crucial in accurately modeling and predicting the behavior of dynamic systems. By using impulse response, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics and control of these systems, making it an essential concept in the field of control engineering.

To model an inelastic collision, we can use the equations derived from the conservation of momentum and energy, taking into account the loss of energy. These equations also consider the masses and velocities of the objects involved, as well as the contact angle between them.



#### Two-dimensional Collision with Two Moving Objects



In a two-dimensional inelastic collision with two moving objects, the final velocities of the objects can be calculated using the following equations:



$$

v'_{1x} = \frac{m_1v_{1x}+m_2v_{2x}+m_2(v_{2x}-v_{1x})\cos(\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}

\\[0.8em]

v'_{1y} = \frac{m_1v_{1y}+m_2v_{2y}+m_2(v_{2y}-v_{1y})\sin(\varphi)}{m_1+m_2}

$$



where $v_{1x}$ and $v_{1y}$ are the initial velocities of the first object in the x and y directions, respectively, and $v_{2x}$ and $v_{2y}$ are the initial velocities of the second object in the x and y directions, respectively. The other variables have the same meaning as in the elastic collision equations.



### Subsection: 16.1b Impulse Response of Collisions



Impulse response is a concept that is closely related to collisions. It refers to the response of a system to an impulse, which is a sudden and short-lived force applied to the system. In the case of collisions, the impulse is the force exerted on the objects during the collision.



To model the impulse response of a collision, we can use the equations derived from the conservation of momentum and energy, taking into account the impulse and the masses and velocities of the objects involved. These equations can be used to determine the change in velocity of the objects after the collision.



#### Two-dimensional Collision with Two Moving Objects



In a two-dimensional collision with two moving objects, the change in velocity of the objects can be calculated using the following equations:



$$

\Delta v_{1x} = \frac{J\cos(\varphi)(m_1+m_2)}{m_1}

\\[0.8em]

\Delta v_{1y} = \frac{J\sin(\varphi)(m_1+m_2)}{m_1}

$$



where $J$ is the impulse applied to the objects during the collision. These equations can be used to determine the final velocities of the objects after the collision, as well as the change in momentum and energy.



### Subsection: 16.1c Applications of Collisions



Collisions have many applications in engineering, particularly in the fields of mechanics and control. In mechanics, collisions are used to study the behavior of objects in motion and to design systems that can withstand impacts. In control, collisions are used to model the response of dynamic systems to sudden disturbances and to design controllers that can mitigate the effects of collisions.



One example of an application of collisions is in the design of airbags for cars. Airbags are designed to deploy during a collision and absorb the impact, reducing the force exerted on the passengers. By modeling the collision using impulse response, engineers can determine the optimal placement and size of the airbags to provide the most effective protection.



Another application of collisions is in the design of robots. Collisions are a common occurrence in robotics, and they can cause damage to the robot and its surroundings. By modeling collisions using impulse response, engineers can design robots that can detect and avoid collisions, reducing the risk of damage.



In conclusion, collisions are a fundamental concept in the field of dynamics and control, and they have many applications in engineering. By understanding the principles of collisions and using impulse response to model them, engineers can design systems that can withstand impacts and mitigate their effects.

### Section: 16.2 Conservation of Momentum:



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of collisions and how they can be modeled using impulse response. In this section, we will explore the concept of conservation of momentum, which is a fundamental principle in physics and plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of dynamic systems.



#### The Principle of Conservation of Momentum



The principle of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant over time, unless acted upon by an external force. This means that the sum of the momenta of all objects in the system remains constant, regardless of any internal forces or collisions between the objects.



Mathematically, this can be expressed as:



$$

\sum \vec{p}_i = \sum \vec{p}_f

$$



where $\vec{p}_i$ is the initial momentum of the system and $\vec{p}_f$ is the final momentum of the system.



#### Understanding Conservation of Momentum



To better understand the principle of conservation of momentum, let's consider a simple example. Imagine a system consisting of two objects, A and B, with masses $m_A$ and $m_B$, respectively. Initially, object A is moving with velocity $\vec{v}_A$ and object B is at rest. When the two objects collide, they exert forces on each other and their velocities change. However, the total momentum of the system remains constant.



We can express this mathematically as:



$$

m_A\vec{v}_A + m_B\vec{v}_B = m_A\vec{v}'_A + m_B\vec{v}'_B

$$



where $\vec{v}'_A$ and $\vec{v}'_B$ are the final velocities of objects A and B, respectively.



#### Applications of Conservation of Momentum



The principle of conservation of momentum has many applications in physics and engineering. In the field of control engineering, it is used to model the behavior of dynamic systems and predict their response to external forces or collisions.



For example, in a car crash, the total momentum of the system (car + passengers) remains constant before and after the collision. This principle can be used to analyze the forces involved in the crash and design safety features to minimize the impact on the passengers.



In the next section, we will explore how the principle of conservation of momentum can be applied to model the impulse response of dynamic systems.

m_A\vec{v}_A + m_B\vec{v}_B = m_A\vec{v}'_A + m_B\vec{v}'_B

$$



where $\vec{v}'_A$ and $\vec{v}'_B$ are the final velocities of objects A and B, respectively.



#### Applications of Conservation of Momentum



The principle of conservation of momentum has many applications in physics and engineering. In the field of control engineering, it is used to model the behavior of dynamic systems and predict their response to external forces or collisions.



For example, in a car crash, the total momentum of the system (car and passengers) remains constant before and after the collision. This principle can be used to analyze the forces involved in the crash and design safety features to minimize the impact on the passengers.



Another application of conservation of momentum is in rocket propulsion. The principle states that for a rocket to move forward, it must expel mass in the opposite direction with a certain velocity. This is known as the rocket equation and is crucial in designing efficient rocket engines.



In conclusion, the principle of conservation of momentum is a fundamental concept in physics and has numerous applications in engineering. It allows us to understand and predict the behavior of dynamic systems and is essential in the design and analysis of various technologies.

### Section: 16.2 Conservation of Momentum:



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of collisions and how they can be modeled using impulse response. In this section, we will explore the concept of conservation of momentum, which is a fundamental principle in physics and plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of dynamic systems.



#### The Principle of Conservation of Momentum



The principle of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant over time, unless acted upon by an external force. This means that the sum of the momenta of all objects in the system remains constant, regardless of any internal forces or collisions between the objects.



Mathematically, this can be expressed as:



$$

\sum \vec{p}_i = \sum \vec{p}_f

$$



where $\vec{p}_i$ is the initial momentum of the system and $\vec{p}_f$ is the final momentum of the system.



#### Understanding Conservation of Momentum



To better understand the principle of conservation of momentum, let's consider a simple example. Imagine a system consisting of two objects, A and B, with masses $m_A$ and $m_B$, respectively. Initially, object A is moving with velocity $\vec{v}_A$ and object B is at rest. When the two objects collide, they exert forces on each other and their velocities change. However, the total momentum of the system remains constant.



We can express this mathematically as:



$$

m_A\vec{v}_A + m_B\vec{v}_B = m_A\vec{v}'_A + m_B\vec{v}'_B

$$



where $\vec{v}'_A$ and $\vec{v}'_B$ are the final velocities of objects A and B, respectively.



#### Applications of Conservation of Momentum



The principle of conservation of momentum has many applications in physics and engineering. In the field of control engineering, it is used to model the behavior of dynamic systems and predict their response to external forces or collisions.



For example, in a car crash, the total momentum of the system (the car and any other objects involved) remains constant before and after the collision. This principle can be used to analyze the forces involved in the crash and predict the resulting damage.



### Subsection: 16.2c Challenges in Conservation of Momentum



While the principle of conservation of momentum is a fundamental concept in physics, there are some challenges in applying it to real-world systems. One of the main challenges is accounting for all the forces acting on a system and accurately measuring the initial and final momenta.



In some cases, external forces may be difficult to measure or may not be fully understood. This can lead to errors in the calculation of the total momentum and can affect the accuracy of the model.



Another challenge is accounting for all the objects in a system and their interactions with each other. In complex systems with multiple objects, it can be difficult to accurately model the forces and momenta involved in collisions.



Despite these challenges, the principle of conservation of momentum remains a powerful tool in modeling dynamic systems and understanding their behavior. By carefully considering all the forces and objects involved, engineers and scientists can use this principle to make accurate predictions and design effective control systems.

### Section: 16.3 Conservation of Energy:



In the previous section, we discussed the principle of conservation of momentum and how it applies to dynamic systems. In this section, we will explore another fundamental principle in physics - the conservation of energy.



#### The Principle of Conservation of Energy



The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. This means that the total energy of a closed system remains constant over time, regardless of any internal or external forces acting on the system.



Mathematically, this can be expressed as:



$$

\sum E_i = \sum E_f

$$



where $\sum E_i$ is the initial energy of the system and $\sum E_f$ is the final energy of the system.



#### Understanding Conservation of Energy



To better understand the principle of conservation of energy, let's consider a simple example. Imagine a system consisting of a ball at the top of a hill. The ball has potential energy due to its position, and when released, it will roll down the hill and gain kinetic energy. However, the total energy of the system (potential energy + kinetic energy) remains constant.



We can express this mathematically as:



$$

mgh_i + \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 = mgh_f + \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2

$$



where $m$ is the mass of the ball, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $h_i$ and $h_f$ are the initial and final heights of the ball, and $v_i$ and $v_f$ are the initial and final velocities of the ball, respectively.



#### Applications of Conservation of Energy



The principle of conservation of energy has many applications in physics and engineering. In the field of control engineering, it is used to model the behavior of dynamic systems and predict their response to external forces or energy inputs.



For example, in a simple pendulum system, the potential energy of the pendulum is converted into kinetic energy as it swings back and forth. The total energy of the system remains constant, and this can be used to predict the motion of the pendulum over time.



### Subsection: 16.3a Understanding Conservation of Energy



Now that we have a basic understanding of the principle of conservation of energy, let's dive deeper into its implications and applications. In this subsection, we will explore the concept of energy transfer and conversion in more detail.



#### Energy Transfer and Conversion



As mentioned earlier, energy can be transferred or converted from one form to another. This is a crucial concept in understanding the behavior of dynamic systems. In a closed system, energy can only be transferred between different components or converted from one form to another.



For example, in an electrical circuit, energy is transferred from the power source to the components in the circuit, such as resistors and capacitors. The energy is then converted into different forms, such as heat and light, as it flows through the circuit.



#### Energy Balance Equations



To model the energy transfer and conversion in a dynamic system, we can use energy balance equations. These equations take into account all the energy inputs, outputs, and conversions in a system and can be used to predict the behavior of the system over time.



For example, in a heating system, the energy balance equation would take into account the energy input from the heating element, the energy output in the form of heat, and any energy conversions that may occur in the system.



### Conclusion



In this section, we have explored the principle of conservation of energy and its applications in dynamic systems. We have seen how energy can be transferred and converted in a closed system, and how energy balance equations can be used to model the behavior of these systems. In the next section, we will apply these concepts to understand the impulse response of dynamic systems.

### Subsection: 16.3c Challenges in Conservation of Energy



While the principle of conservation of energy is a fundamental concept in physics, there are challenges in applying it to real-world systems. One of the main challenges is accounting for all forms of energy in a system and accurately measuring them.



In the context of building energy systems, there are various sources of energy that need to be considered, such as thermal energy, electrical energy, and mechanical energy. Additionally, there may be losses of energy due to factors like friction or heat transfer. These factors can make it difficult to accurately model and predict the behavior of a building's energy system.



Another challenge is accounting for uncertainties in energy calculations. As mentioned in the related context, there are uncertainties in building design and occupant behavior that can significantly impact the energy demand of a building. These uncertainties must be taken into account when using the principle of conservation of energy to model building energy systems.



To address these challenges, researchers have developed methods for quantifying and reducing uncertainties in energy calculations. These methods involve considering factors such as workmanship, occupant behavior, and building materials in energy models.



In conclusion, while the principle of conservation of energy is a fundamental concept, there are challenges in applying it to real-world systems. By accounting for uncertainties and accurately measuring all forms of energy, we can better model and predict the behavior of dynamic systems.

## Section: 17.1b Key Concepts from 2.003



In this subsection, we will delve deeper into some of the key concepts covered in 2.003. These concepts are essential for understanding plane-motion kinematics and will serve as a foundation for the rest of this chapter.



### Kinematics



As mentioned earlier, kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. In 2.003, we learned about the three basic types of motion: rectilinear, curvilinear, and rotational. Rectilinear motion is motion along a straight line, while curvilinear motion is motion along a curved path. Rotational motion, on the other hand, involves objects rotating around a fixed axis.



To describe these types of motion, we use equations such as the position, velocity, and acceleration equations. For example, the position equation for rectilinear motion is given by $x(t) = x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$, where $x_0$ is the initial position, $v_0$ is the initial velocity, and $a$ is the acceleration. These equations allow us to calculate the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object at any given time.



### Dynamics



Dynamics is the study of motion in relation to the forces that cause it. In 2.003, we learned about the equations of motion, which describe the relationship between an object's position, velocity, acceleration, and the forces acting on it. These equations are essential for understanding how objects move in response to different forces.



One of the key concepts in dynamics is the principle of superposition. This principle states that the total effect of multiple forces acting on an object is equal to the sum of the individual effects of each force. This allows us to break down complex systems into simpler parts and analyze them separately.



### Control Systems



Control systems are systems that use feedback to maintain a desired output. In 2.003, we learned about the different types of control systems, such as open-loop and closed-loop systems. Open-loop systems do not use feedback, while closed-loop systems do. We also learned about the concept of stability, which is crucial for designing effective control systems.

### Section: 17.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 17.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



In the previous section, we provided a brief review of the concepts covered in the course 2.003: Modeling Dynamics and Control I. Now, we will dive deeper into the topic of plane-motion kinematics, specifically focusing on rigid bodies.



A rigid body is an idealized physical body that does not deform or change shape under the action of external forces. In reality, all bodies deform to some extent, but for the purpose of simplifying our analysis, we will assume that the bodies we are studying are rigid.



In plane-motion kinematics, we are interested in the motion of rigid bodies in a two-dimensional plane. This type of motion is commonly seen in engineering applications, such as in the motion of vehicles, robots, and machinery. To understand the motion of rigid bodies, we need to define some key concepts and parameters.



First, we define the position of a rigid body as the location of a reference point on the body. This reference point is often referred to as the center of mass, and it is the point around which the body rotates. The position of the body can be described using Cartesian coordinates or polar coordinates, depending on the type of motion being analyzed.



Next, we define the orientation of a rigid body as the direction in which the body is facing. This can be described using angles, such as the yaw, pitch, and roll angles, or using a rotation matrix. The orientation of the body is important in determining how it moves and interacts with its environment.



To fully understand the motion of a rigid body, we need to consider both its position and orientation. This is where the concept of kinematic chains comes into play. A kinematic chain is a series of rigid bodies connected by joints, which allows for relative motion between the bodies. By analyzing the kinematic chain, we can determine the position and orientation of each body in the chain.



In this section, we will explore the different types of motion that can occur in a plane, such as translation, rotation, and general plane motion. We will also discuss the equations and diagrams used to describe these types of motion, as well as the concept of relative motion and how it applies to rigid bodies.



By the end of this section, readers will have a solid understanding of the kinematics of rigid bodies in a plane, which will serve as a foundation for the more complex topics covered in the following sections.

### Subsection: 17.2b Applications of Plane-motion Kinematics



In the previous section, we discussed the basic concepts of plane-motion kinematics for rigid bodies. Now, we will explore some of the practical applications of this topic.



One of the most common applications of plane-motion kinematics is in the field of factory automation. In this context, kinematic chains are used to model the movement of robotic arms and other machinery. By understanding the kinematics of these systems, engineers can design more efficient and precise automation processes.



Another important application of plane-motion kinematics is in the field of spacecraft dynamics. Poinsot's construction, also known as the Poinsot's ellipsoid, is a visualization tool used to understand the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. This construction is based on the principles of plane-motion kinematics and is essential for spacecraft control and navigation.



In addition to these specific applications, the concepts of plane-motion kinematics are also used in a variety of other fields. For example, the concept of kinetic width, which is the maximum distance between two points on a moving body, is used in computer graphics and animation to create realistic movements.



For those interested in further reading on this topic, the extended Kalman filter is a useful tool for estimating the state of a system based on noisy measurements. This filter is based on the principles of plane-motion kinematics and is commonly used in control systems and robotics.



Finally, it is worth noting that the continuous-time extended Kalman filter, unlike its discrete-time counterpart, has coupled prediction and update steps. This means that the prediction step is affected by the update step, making it a more complex and challenging tool to use.



In summary, plane-motion kinematics is a fundamental topic in the study of dynamics and control. Its applications are vast and diverse, ranging from factory automation to spacecraft dynamics.

### Section: 17.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 17.2c Challenges in Plane-motion Kinematics



In the previous section, we discussed the basic concepts and applications of plane-motion kinematics for rigid bodies. However, as with any mathematical model, there are certain challenges that arise when applying these concepts to real-world systems. In this section, we will explore some of these challenges and how they can be addressed.



One of the main challenges in plane-motion kinematics is dealing with non-rigid bodies. While the concepts we have discussed so far assume that the body is rigid, in reality, most objects have some degree of flexibility. This can lead to errors in the kinematic model and affect the accuracy of predictions. To address this challenge, advanced techniques such as finite element analysis can be used to model the flexibility of the body and incorporate it into the kinematic equations.



Another challenge is dealing with non-uniform motion. So far, we have assumed that the motion of the body is uniform, meaning that all points on the body move with the same velocity and acceleration. However, in many real-world systems, this is not the case. For example, in a robotic arm, different joints may have different velocities and accelerations. To account for this, we can use the concept of relative motion, where the motion of each point is described relative to a chosen reference point.



In addition to these challenges, there are also limitations in the assumptions made in plane-motion kinematics. For example, we have assumed that the body is moving in a two-dimensional plane, but in reality, many systems have three-dimensional motion. In these cases, more advanced kinematic models, such as spatial kinematics, must be used.



Furthermore, the accuracy of the kinematic model is highly dependent on the accuracy of the measurements used to determine the motion of the body. In real-world systems, there may be noise and errors in these measurements, which can lead to inaccuracies in the kinematic model. To address this, advanced filtering techniques, such as the extended Kalman filter mentioned in the previous section, can be used to estimate the true state of the system based on noisy measurements.



In summary, while plane-motion kinematics provides a powerful tool for modeling the motion of rigid bodies, there are several challenges that must be considered when applying these concepts to real-world systems. By understanding and addressing these challenges, we can create more accurate and reliable kinematic models for a wide range of applications.

### Section: 17.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 17.3a Understanding Plane-motion Dynamics



In the previous section, we discussed the kinematics of plane motion for rigid bodies. Now, we will delve into the dynamics of these systems, which involves understanding the forces and torques acting on the body and how they affect its motion.



#### Forces and Torques



In order to understand the dynamics of a rigid body in plane motion, we must first consider the forces and torques acting on the body. These forces and torques can be divided into two categories: external and internal.



External forces and torques are those that act on the body from outside sources, such as gravity, friction, or applied forces. These forces and torques can be represented by vectors, with the direction and magnitude determined by the properties of the body and the external environment.



Internal forces and torques, on the other hand, are those that act between different parts of the body. These forces and torques are a result of the body's structure and can be more difficult to determine. However, they are crucial in understanding the overall dynamics of the system.



#### Equations of Motion



Once we have identified the external and internal forces and torques acting on the body, we can use Newton's laws of motion to derive the equations of motion for the system. These equations describe the relationship between the forces and torques acting on the body and its resulting motion.



In plane motion, we can use the equations of motion to determine the translational and rotational motion of the body. This involves solving for the acceleration, velocity, and position of the body's center of mass, as well as the angular acceleration, angular velocity, and orientation of the body.



#### Challenges in Plane-motion Dynamics



Similar to the challenges faced in plane-motion kinematics, there are also challenges in applying the concepts of plane-motion dynamics to real-world systems. One of the main challenges is dealing with non-rigid bodies, as the assumptions made for rigid bodies may not hold true. In these cases, more advanced techniques, such as finite element analysis, must be used to accurately model the flexibility of the body.



Another challenge is dealing with non-uniform motion, where different points on the body may have different velocities and accelerations. To address this, we can use the concept of relative motion, as discussed in the previous section.



Furthermore, the assumptions made in plane-motion dynamics, such as the body moving in a two-dimensional plane, may not hold true for all systems. In these cases, more advanced models, such as spatial dynamics, must be used.



#### Conclusion



In this section, we have explored the basics of plane-motion dynamics for rigid bodies. By understanding the forces and torques acting on the body and using the equations of motion, we can accurately predict the motion of the system. However, it is important to keep in mind the challenges and limitations that may arise when applying these concepts to real-world systems.

#### Aerospace Engineering



One of the most prominent applications of plane-motion dynamics is in the field of aerospace engineering. The study of aircraft and spacecraft dynamics heavily relies on the principles of plane motion, as these systems often involve rigid bodies moving in two dimensions.



For example, in the design and control of an aircraft, understanding the forces and torques acting on the body is crucial in determining its stability and maneuverability. The equations of motion for plane motion can be used to model the behavior of an aircraft in flight and aid in the design of control systems to ensure safe and efficient operation.



#### Robotics



Another field that heavily relies on plane-motion dynamics is robotics. Robots often involve rigid bodies moving in two dimensions, and the principles of plane motion are essential in understanding their behavior and designing control systems for them.



For instance, in the design of a robotic arm, the equations of motion for plane motion can be used to determine the forces and torques required to move the arm to a desired position and orientation. This information is crucial in designing the motors and actuators needed to control the arm's motion accurately.



#### Biomechanics



The study of human and animal movement, known as biomechanics, also utilizes plane-motion dynamics. By understanding the forces and torques acting on the body during different movements, researchers can gain insights into the mechanics of human and animal locomotion.



For example, in sports science, biomechanics is used to analyze the movements of athletes and improve their performance. By studying the forces and torques involved in different sports movements, coaches and trainers can develop training programs to optimize an athlete's performance.



#### Conclusion



In conclusion, the principles of plane-motion dynamics have a wide range of applications in various fields, including aerospace engineering, robotics, and biomechanics. By understanding the forces and torques acting on a rigid body in plane motion, we can gain insights into the behavior of complex systems and design control systems to optimize their performance.

### Section: 17.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 17.3c Challenges in Plane-motion Dynamics



In the previous section, we discussed the equations of motion for a rigid body in plane motion and explored some applications of these dynamics in various fields. However, as with any mathematical model, there are challenges and limitations that must be considered when using plane-motion dynamics.



#### Nonlinear Dynamics



One of the main challenges in plane-motion dynamics is dealing with nonlinear systems. In many real-world scenarios, the equations of motion for a rigid body in plane motion are nonlinear, making them difficult to solve analytically. This can lead to the need for numerical methods and approximations, which may introduce errors and limitations in the model.



#### Complex Systems



Another challenge in plane-motion dynamics is dealing with complex systems. In some cases, the rigid body may have multiple degrees of freedom, making the equations of motion more complicated and difficult to solve. Additionally, the presence of external forces and torques, such as friction and air resistance, can further complicate the dynamics of the system.



#### Assumptions and Simplifications



In order to make the equations of motion more manageable, certain assumptions and simplifications are often made. For example, the rigid body may be assumed to be perfectly rigid, neglecting any deformations or flexibility. This can lead to inaccuracies in the model, especially in systems where flexibility plays a significant role.



#### Experimental Validation



Finally, it is important to note that the equations of motion for a rigid body in plane motion are based on theoretical models and assumptions. In order to accurately predict the behavior of a real-world system, experimental validation is necessary. This can involve collecting data and comparing it to the model's predictions, or using advanced techniques such as system identification to refine the model.



Despite these challenges, plane-motion dynamics remains a powerful tool in understanding and predicting the behavior of rigid bodies in two dimensions. By carefully considering the limitations and continuously improving the models through experimental validation, we can continue to advance our understanding of complex systems and their dynamics.

## Chapter 18: Brief Review of 2.003:



### Section: 18.1 Uniaxial Motion:



In this section, we will briefly review the concept of uniaxial motion, which is a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and control. Uniaxial motion refers to the motion of an object along a single axis, or in other words, motion in one direction. This type of motion is commonly seen in many engineering systems, such as a car moving along a straight road or a pendulum swinging back and forth.



To understand uniaxial motion, we must first understand the concept of rotation formalisms in three dimensions. This involves converting from axis-angle representation to other forms, such as quaternions or dual quaternions. These formalisms are essential for describing the orientation and motion of objects in three-dimensional space.



One important aspect of uniaxial motion is rational motion, which involves the use of rational Bézier and B-spline motions. These are mathematical techniques used to model the motion of objects in a smooth and efficient manner. Rational Bézier curves are defined by a set of unit dual quaternions and dual weights, while B-spline curves are defined by B-spline basis functions.



To better understand uniaxial motion, we must also understand the concept of homogeneous coordinates. These are used to represent points in three-dimensional space and are crucial for describing the transformation of objects in motion. The transformation equation for uniaxial motion in terms of quaternions is given by:



$$

\tilde {\textbf{P}} = \textbf{Q}\textbf{P}\textbf{Q}^\ast + P_4 [(\textbf{Q}^0)\textbf{Q}^\ast - \textbf{Q}(\textbf{Q}^0)^\ast],

$$



where $\textbf{Q}$ and $\textbf{Q}^0$ are quaternions, and $\textbf{P}$ is the point being transformed. This equation shows how the point $\textbf{P}$ is transformed by the quaternion $\textbf{Q}$ and its conjugate $\textbf{Q}^\ast$.



In summary, uniaxial motion is a fundamental concept in the study of dynamics and control. It involves the use of rotation formalisms, rational motion techniques, and homogeneous coordinates to model the motion of objects in one direction. Understanding uniaxial motion is crucial for understanding more complex systems and designing control systems to regulate them. In the next section, we will dive deeper into the understanding of uniaxial motion by exploring its applications in the field of engineering.

### Section: 18.1 Uniaxial Motion:



In this section, we will continue our discussion on uniaxial motion and its applications in dynamics and control. We will also explore some additional concepts related to uniaxial motion, such as Poinsot's ellipsoid and kinetic width.



#### 18.1a Poinsot's Ellipsoid



One of the applications of uniaxial motion is in visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. This is where Poinsot's ellipsoid comes into play. Poinsot's ellipsoid is a geometric construction that helps us understand the rotation of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. It is defined by the principal moments of inertia of the body and represents the inertia ellipsoid of the body.



The ellipsoid is named after the French mathematician Louis Poinsot, who first introduced it in 1834. It is a useful tool for visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit and can also be used to analyze the stability of the spacecraft's motion.

## Chapter 18: Brief Review of 2.003:



### Section: 18.2 Fixed-axis Rotation:



In this section, we will continue our discussion on rotation formalisms in three dimensions, specifically focusing on fixed-axis rotation. We will explore the conversion from axis-angle representation to rotation matrices, as well as alternate methods for computing rotation matrices.



#### 18.2a Understanding Fixed-axis Rotation



Fixed-axis rotation is a commonly used method for representing the rotation of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. It involves rotating the body around a fixed axis, which can be defined by a unit vector <math>{a} = [{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>. This axis is normalized to have a magnitude of 1, making it easier to work with mathematically.



To convert from axis-angle representation to a rotation matrix, we can use the following formula:



$$

R = \begin{bmatrix}

\cos \theta + a_x^2 (1-\cos \theta) & a_x a_y (1-\cos \theta) - a_z \sin \theta & a_y \sin \theta + a_x a_z (1-\cos \theta) \\

a_x a_y (1-\cos \theta) + a_z \sin \theta & \cos \theta + a_y^2 (1-\cos \theta) & a_y a_z (1-\cos \theta) - a_x \sin \theta \\

a_x a_z (1-\cos \theta) - a_y \sin \theta & a_y a_z (1-\cos \theta) + a_x \sin \theta & \cos \theta + a_z^{2} (1-\cos \theta)

\end{bmatrix}

$$



This formula is derived from rotating the vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) and reducing constants. It is important to note that the angle of rotation, <math>{\theta}</math>, is equal to the magnitude of the input axis, <math>{a}</math>.



Alternatively, we can use the following formula to compute the rotation matrix:



$$

R = \begin{bmatrix}

1 - 2 q_y^2 - 2 q_z^2 & 2(q_x q_y - q_z q_r) & 2(q_x q_z + q_y q_r)\\

2(q_x q_y + q_z q_r) & 1 - 2 q_x^2 - 2q_z^2 & 2(q_y q_z - q_x q_r)\\

2(q_x q_z - q_y q_r) & 2(q_y q_z + q_x q_r) & 1 - 2 q_x^2 - 2 q_y^2

\end{bmatrix}

$$



This formula is derived from converting the input axis, <math>{Q}=[{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>, to an angle-axis representation, <math>{\theta} = \|Q\|</math>, and <math>[x,y,z] = \frac {Q} {\|Q\|}</math>. It is important to note that the input axis must be normalized before using this formula.



Fixed-axis rotation also has applications in vector rotation. We can rotate a vector, <math>{v} = (X, Y, Z)</math>, around the rotation axis, <math>{Q} = (X,Y,Z)</math>, using the following formula:



$$

v' = \begin{bmatrix}

\cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\

\sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\

0 & 0 & 1

\end{bmatrix} v

$$



This formula involves calculating the cosine of the angle times the vector to rotate, plus the sine of the angle times the axis of rotation, plus one minus the cosine of the angle times the dot product of the vector and rotation axis times the axis of rotation. The dot product includes the cosine of the angle between the vector being rotated and the axis of rotation times the length of <math>{v}</math>, while the cross product includes the sine of the angle between the vector being rotated and the axis of rotation.



In conclusion, fixed-axis rotation is a useful tool for representing the rotation of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. It has various applications in engineering systems, such as robotic arms and suspension systems for vehicles. By understanding the conversion from axis-angle representation to rotation matrices and alternate methods for computing rotation matrices, we can effectively model and control the motion of a rigid body.

a_x a_y (1-\cos \theta) + a_z \sin \theta & \cos \theta + a_y^2 (1-\cos \theta) & a_y a_z (1-\cos \theta) - a_x \sin \theta \\

a_x a_z (1-\cos \theta) - a_y \sin \theta & a_y a_z (1-\cos \theta) + a_x \sin \theta & \cos \theta + a_z^{2} (1-\cos \theta)

\end{bmatrix}

$$



This formula is derived from rotating the vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) and reducing constants. It is important to note that the angle of rotation, <math>{\theta}</math>, is equal to the magnitude of the input axis, <math>{a}</math>.



Alternatively, we can use the following formula to compute the rotation matrix:



$$

R = \begin{bmatrix}

1 - 2 q_y^2 - 2 q_z^2 & 2(q_x q_y - q_z q_r) & 2(q_x q_z + q_y q_r)\\

2(q_x q_y + q_z q_r) & 1 - 2 q_x^2 - 2q_z^2 & 2(q_y q_z - q_x q_r)\\

2(q_x q_z - q_y q_r) & 2(q_y q_z + q_x q_r) & 1 - 2 q_x^2 - 2 q_y^2

\end{bmatrix}

$$



This formula is derived from converting the input axis, <math>{Q}=[{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>, to an angle-axis representation. The rotation matrix is then calculated using the cosine of the angle times the vector to rotate, plus the sine of the angle times the axis of rotation, plus one minus the cosine of the angle times the dot product of the vector and rotation axis times the axis of rotation.



#### 18.2b Applications of Fixed-axis Rotation



Fixed-axis rotation has many practical applications in engineering and physics. One of the most common applications is in visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. By using fixed-axis rotation, we can easily track the orientation of the spacecraft as it moves through space.



Another application is in line integral convolution, a technique used to visualize vector fields. By using fixed-axis rotation, we can rotate the vector field and observe how it changes over time, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the system.



In addition, fixed-axis rotation is also used in basis matrix computation. This involves rotating the vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) and reducing constants to compute the resulting matrix. This matrix can then be used in various control and dynamics calculations.



Overall, fixed-axis rotation is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the dynamics of systems in three-dimensional space. Its applications are vast and continue to be utilized in various fields of study.

#### 18.2a Understanding Fixed-axis Rotation



Fixed-axis rotation is a commonly used method for representing the rotation of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. It involves rotating the body around a fixed axis, which can be defined by a unit vector <math>{a} = [{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>. This axis is normalized to have a magnitude of 1, making it easier to work with mathematically.



To convert from axis-angle representation to a rotation matrix, we can use the following formula:



$$

R = \begin{bmatrix}

\cos \theta + a_x^2 (1-\cos \theta) & a_x a_y (1-\cos \theta) - a_z \sin \theta & a_y \sin \theta + a_x a_z (1-\cos \theta) \\

a_x a_y (1-\cos \theta) + a_z \sin \theta & \cos \theta + a_y^2 (1-\cos \theta) & a_y a_z (1-\cos \theta) - a_x \sin \theta \\

a_x a_z (1-\cos \theta) - a_y \sin \theta & a_y a_z (1-\cos \theta) + a_x \sin \theta & \cos \theta + a_z^{2} (1-\cos \theta)

\end{bmatrix}

$$



This formula is derived from rotating the vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) and reducing constants. It is important to note that the angle of rotation, <math>{\theta}</math>, is equal to the magnitude of the input axis, <math>{a}</math>.



Alternatively, we can use the following formula to compute the rotation matrix:



$$

R = \begin{bmatrix}

1 - 2 q_y^2 - 2 q_z^2 & 2(q_x q_y - q_z q_r) & 2(q_x q_z + q_y q_r)\\

2(q_x q_y + q_z q_r) & 1 - 2 q_x^2 - 2q_z^2 & 2(q_y q_z - q_x q_r)\\

2(q_x q_z - q_y q_r) & 2(q_y q_z + q_x q_r) & 1 - 2 q_x^2 - 2 q_y^2

\end{bmatrix}

$$



This formula is derived from converting the input axis, <math>{Q}=[{X}, {Y}, {Z}]</math>, to an angle-axis representation. The rotation matrix can then be computed using the quaternion elements <math>{q_x, q_y, q_z, q_r}</math>. This method is commonly used in computer graphics and robotics.



#### 18.2b Applications of Fixed-axis Rotation



Fixed-axis rotation has various applications in engineering and physics. One of the most common applications is in visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. By using fixed-axis rotation, we can easily track the orientation of the spacecraft as it moves through space.



Another application is in the design and control of aircraft. Fixed-axis rotation is used to model the dynamics of aircraft motion, allowing engineers to predict and control the behavior of the aircraft in flight.



#### 18.2c Challenges in Fixed-axis Rotation



While fixed-axis rotation is a useful tool for modeling dynamics and control, it does have its limitations. One of the main challenges is dealing with singularities, where the rotation matrix becomes undefined. This can occur when the rotation axis is aligned with one of the coordinate axes, resulting in a division by zero in the rotation matrix formula.



Another challenge is the difficulty in visualizing rotations in higher dimensions. In three dimensions, we can easily visualize a rotation around a fixed axis, but in higher dimensions, there are multiple axis-planes that are left invariant by the rotation. This makes it more challenging to understand and visualize the rotation.



Despite these challenges, fixed-axis rotation remains a valuable tool in modeling dynamics and control, and with advancements in technology and visualization techniques, we can continue to overcome these challenges and gain a deeper understanding of rotational motion in higher dimensions.

### Section: 18.3 First and Second Order Systems:



In this section, we will review the concepts of first and second order systems, which are essential in understanding the dynamics and control of physical systems. We will also discuss the differences between these two types of systems and their applications.



#### 18.3a Understanding First Order Systems



A first order system is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of a system with a single energy storage element, such as a capacitor or an inductor. These systems are characterized by a first order differential equation, which relates the input and output of the system. The most common example of a first order system is the RC circuit, which consists of a resistor and a capacitor connected in series.



To better understand first order systems, let's consider the RC circuit. The input to this system is the voltage across the resistor, and the output is the voltage across the capacitor. The behavior of the system is described by the following first order differential equation:



$$

\frac{dV_c}{dt} = \frac{1}{RC}(V_i - V_c)

$$



where <math>{V_c}</math> is the voltage across the capacitor, <math>{V_i}</math> is the input voltage, and <math>{R}</math> and <math>{C}</math> are the resistance and capacitance of the circuit, respectively.



One important characteristic of first order systems is their time constant, which is defined as the time it takes for the system to reach 63.2% of its steady-state value. In the case of the RC circuit, the time constant is given by <math>{\tau = RC}</math>. This parameter is crucial in understanding the transient response of the system.



First order systems have a wide range of applications in engineering, including electrical circuits, mechanical systems, and chemical processes. They are also used in control systems to model the dynamics of physical systems and design controllers to regulate their behavior.



In conclusion, first order systems are an essential concept in modeling the dynamics and control of physical systems. They are characterized by a first order differential equation and have a time constant that determines their transient response. Understanding these systems is crucial for engineers and scientists working in various fields.

### Section: 18.3 First and Second Order Systems:



In this section, we will review the concepts of first and second order systems, which are essential in understanding the dynamics and control of physical systems. We will also discuss the differences between these two types of systems and their applications.



#### 18.3a Understanding First Order Systems



A first order system is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of a system with a single energy storage element, such as a capacitor or an inductor. These systems are characterized by a first order differential equation, which relates the input and output of the system. The most common example of a first order system is the RC circuit, which consists of a resistor and a capacitor connected in series.



To better understand first order systems, let's consider the RC circuit. The input to this system is the voltage across the resistor, and the output is the voltage across the capacitor. The behavior of the system is described by the following first order differential equation:



$$

\frac{dV_c}{dt} = \frac{1}{RC}(V_i - V_c)

$$



where <math>{V_c}</math> is the voltage across the capacitor, <math>{V_i}</math> is the input voltage, and <math>{R}</math> and <math>{C}</math> are the resistance and capacitance of the circuit, respectively.



One important characteristic of first order systems is their time constant, which is defined as the time it takes for the system to reach 63.2% of its steady-state value. In the case of the RC circuit, the time constant is given by <math>{\tau = RC}</math>. This parameter is crucial in understanding the transient response of the system.



First order systems have a wide range of applications in engineering, including electrical circuits, mechanical systems, and chemical processes. They are also used in control systems to model the dynamics of physical systems and design controllers to regulate their behavior. In the field of control theory, first order systems are often used as building blocks for more complex systems, as they provide a simple and intuitive way to understand the behavior of a system.



#### 18.3b Understanding Second Order Systems



While first order systems are useful for modeling systems with a single energy storage element, many physical systems require a more complex model. Second order systems, on the other hand, are able to capture the dynamics of systems with two energy storage elements, such as a mass-spring-damper system.



The behavior of a second order system is described by a second order differential equation, which relates the input and output of the system. The most common example of a second order system is the mass-spring-damper system, which consists of a mass connected to a spring and a damper.



To better understand second order systems, let's consider the mass-spring-damper system. The input to this system is the force applied to the mass, and the output is the position of the mass. The behavior of the system is described by the following second order differential equation:



$$

m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F

$$



where <math>{m}</math> is the mass, <math>{c}</math> is the damping coefficient, <math>{k}</math> is the spring constant, and <math>{F}</math> is the applied force.



Similar to first order systems, second order systems also have a time constant, which is defined as the time it takes for the system to reach 63.2% of its steady-state value. However, in the case of second order systems, the time constant is given by <math>{\tau = \frac{1}{\zeta\omega_n}}</math>, where <math>{\zeta}</math> is the damping ratio and <math>{\omega_n}</math> is the natural frequency of the system.



Second order systems have a wide range of applications in engineering, including mechanical systems, electrical circuits, and control systems. They are particularly useful in control systems, as they can accurately model the dynamics of many physical systems and allow for the design of effective controllers.



In conclusion, first and second order systems are fundamental concepts in the study of dynamics and control. While first order systems are simpler and easier to understand, second order systems are able to capture the dynamics of more complex systems. Both types of systems have important applications in engineering and are essential for understanding and designing control systems.

First order systems have a wide range of applications in engineering, including electrical circuits, mechanical systems, and chemical processes. They are also used in control systems to model the dynamics of physical systems and design controllers to regulate their behavior. In fact, first order systems are the building blocks of more complex systems and are often used to approximate the behavior of higher order systems.



#### 18.3b Understanding Second Order Systems



Unlike first order systems, second order systems have two energy storage elements and are characterized by a second order differential equation. These systems are commonly found in mechanical systems, such as mass-spring-damper systems, and electrical systems, such as RLC circuits.



To illustrate the behavior of a second order system, let's consider the mass-spring-damper system. The input to this system is the force applied to the mass, and the output is the displacement of the mass. The behavior of the system is described by the following second order differential equation:



$$

m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = F

$$



where <math>{m}</math> is the mass, <math>{c}</math> is the damping coefficient, <math>{k}</math> is the spring constant, and <math>{F}</math> is the applied force.



Similar to first order systems, second order systems also have a time constant, but in this case, it is given by <math>{\tau = \frac{c}{2m}}</math>. This parameter is important in understanding the damping of the system and its response to external forces.



Second order systems have a wide range of applications in engineering, including control systems, signal processing, and vibration analysis. They are also used to model complex physical systems, such as vehicles, aircraft, and robots.



### 18.3c Comparing First and Second Order Systems



Now that we have a basic understanding of first and second order systems, let's compare the two. One key difference between these two types of systems is their order of complexity. First order systems have a single energy storage element and are described by a first order differential equation, while second order systems have two energy storage elements and are described by a second order differential equation. This means that second order systems are more complex and require more parameters to fully describe their behavior.



Another difference is the response time of the systems. First order systems have a faster response time compared to second order systems, as they have a shorter time constant. This means that first order systems reach their steady-state value quicker than second order systems.



In terms of applications, first order systems are often used to approximate the behavior of higher order systems, while second order systems are used to model more complex physical systems. Additionally, first order systems are commonly used in control systems, while second order systems have a wider range of applications, including signal processing and vibration analysis.



In conclusion, first and second order systems are both important in understanding the dynamics and control of physical systems. While they have some similarities, they also have distinct differences in terms of complexity, response time, and applications. It is important to have a solid understanding of both types of systems in order to effectively model and control physical systems.

## Chapter 19: Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 19.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



In this section, we will build upon the concepts covered in 2.003 and apply them to the more complex dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion. We will begin by reviewing the fundamental principles of dynamics and then delve into the equations of motion for rigid bodies.



#### 19.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



Before we can fully understand the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion, we must first review the kinematics of rigid bodies. In 2.003, we learned that the motion of a rigid body can be described by the translation and rotation of its center of mass. This translation and rotation can be represented by the position and orientation of the body in space.



To describe the position and orientation of a rigid body, we use a set of coordinates known as the body-fixed frame. This frame is attached to the body and moves with it, allowing us to track the position and orientation of the body as it moves through space.



The motion of a rigid body can be broken down into two components: translational motion and rotational motion. Translational motion is the movement of the body's center of mass in a straight line, while rotational motion is the rotation of the body about its center of mass.



To fully describe the motion of a rigid body, we use a combination of translation and rotation matrices. These matrices allow us to track the position and orientation of the body at any given time.



In addition to translation and rotation, we must also consider the velocity and acceleration of a rigid body. The velocity of a rigid body is the rate of change of its position, while the acceleration is the rate of change of its velocity. These quantities can be described using the same translation and rotation matrices used to describe the position and orientation of the body.



By understanding the kinematics of rigid bodies, we can now move on to the more complex dynamics of plane motion. In the next section, we will explore the equations of motion for rigid bodies in plane motion and how they can be used to analyze and control the behavior of these systems.





# Modeling Dynamics and Control II:



## Chapter 19: Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Section: 19.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



In this section, we will continue our exploration of the dynamics of rigid bodies in plane motion. In the previous section, we reviewed the fundamental principles of dynamics and introduced the concept of kinematics for rigid bodies. Now, we will delve deeper into the equations of motion for rigid bodies and explore their applications.



#### 19.2b Applications of Plane-motion Kinematics



The kinematics of rigid bodies have many practical applications in engineering and physics. One of the most common applications is in the design and control of robotic systems. By understanding the kinematics of rigid bodies, engineers can design robots that can move and manipulate objects with precision and accuracy.



Another important application is in the field of aerospace engineering. The motion of spacecraft and satellites in orbit can be described using the same principles of kinematics that we have discussed. This allows engineers to accurately predict and control the motion of these complex systems.



One of the most useful tools for visualizing the motion of a rigid body is Poinsot's construction, also known as Poinsot's ellipsoid. This construction allows us to visualize the rotation of a rigid body in three-dimensional space by representing its motion as an ellipsoid. This visualization is particularly useful in understanding the complex motion of spacecraft and satellites in orbit.



In addition to these practical applications, the kinematics of rigid bodies also have important theoretical implications. For example, the concept of kinetic width, which is the maximum distance between two points on a rigid body, is closely related to Poinsot's construction and can be used to analyze the stability of a rotating body.

## Generalizations



The concepts of kinematics and dynamics that we have discussed in this chapter can be extended to more complex systems. One such extension is the continuous-time extended Kalman filter, which is used for state estimation in systems with continuous-time models and discrete-time measurements.



### Continuous-time extended Kalman filter



The continuous-time extended Kalman filter is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a system with continuous-time dynamics and discrete-time measurements. It is an extension of the discrete-time extended Kalman filter, which is commonly used for state estimation in systems with discrete-time dynamics and measurements.



The model for the continuous-time extended Kalman filter is given by:



$$

\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr)

$$



$$

\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)

$$



The continuous-time extended Kalman filter follows a predict-update cycle, similar to the discrete-time extended Kalman filter. The steps for this cycle are:



1. Initialize the state estimate and covariance matrix at time $t_0$:

$$

\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t_0) = E\bigl[\mathbf{x}(t_0)\bigr] \quad \mathbf{P}(t_0) = Var\bigl[\mathbf{x}(t_0)\bigr]

$$



2. Predict the state and covariance at time $t$:

$$

\dot{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}(t) = f\bigl(\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)\bigr)+\mathbf{K}(t)\Bigl(\mathbf{z}(t)-h\bigl(\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)\bigr)\Bigr)

$$



$$

\dot{\mathbf{P}}(t) = \mathbf{F}(t)\mathbf{P}(t)+\mathbf{P}(t)\mathbf{F}(t)^{T}-\mathbf{K}(t)\mathbf{H}(t)\mathbf{P}(t)+\mathbf{Q}(t)

$$



3. Update the state and covariance at time $t$:

$$

\mathbf{K}(t) = \mathbf{P}(t)\mathbf{H}(t)^{T}\mathbf{R}(t)^{-1}

$$



$$

\mathbf{F}(t) = \left . \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{x} } \right \vert _{\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t),\mathbf{u}(t)}

$$



$$

\mathbf{H}(t) = \left . \frac{\partial h}{\partial \mathbf{x} } \right \vert _{\hat{\mathbf{x}}(t)}

$$



Unlike the discrete-time extended Kalman filter, the prediction and update steps are coupled in the continuous-time extended Kalman filter.



#### Discrete-time measurements



In many practical applications, measurements are taken at discrete time intervals, even though the system is modeled using continuous-time dynamics. In these cases, the system model and measurement model are given by:



$$

\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = f\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{w}(t) \quad \mathbf{w}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{Q}(t)\bigr)

$$



$$

\mathbf{z}(t) = h\bigl(\mathbf{x}(t)\bigr) + \mathbf{v}(t) \quad \mathbf{v}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\bigl(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{R}(t)\bigr)

$$



However, the prediction and update steps for the continuous-time extended Kalman filter remain the same. This is because the discrete-time measurements can be interpolated to obtain continuous-time measurements, which can then be used in the prediction and update steps.

While the kinematics of rigid bodies have many practical applications, they also present several challenges that must be addressed in order to accurately model and control these systems. One of the main challenges is dealing with the complexity of the equations of motion for rigid bodies. These equations involve multiple variables and parameters, making it difficult to analyze and predict the motion of a rigid body.



Another challenge is the accurate measurement and tracking of the motion of a rigid body. In order to control a rigid body, we must be able to accurately measure its position, velocity, and acceleration. However, due to factors such as sensor noise and external disturbances, it can be challenging to obtain precise measurements of these quantities.



Furthermore, the motion of a rigid body can be affected by external forces and torques, making it difficult to predict and control its behavior. These external forces and torques can come from a variety of sources, such as friction, air resistance, and contact with other objects. Accounting for these external influences is crucial in accurately modeling the dynamics of a rigid body.



In addition to these challenges, the kinematics of rigid bodies also have theoretical implications that must be considered. For example, the concept of kinetic width, which is closely related to Poinsot's construction, can be difficult to calculate and analyze in certain cases.

### Subsection: 19.3b Hierarchical Equations of Motion



In order to accurately model the dynamics of a rigid body, we must consider the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). These equations take into account the various forces and torques acting on a rigid body and how they affect its motion. The HEOM method is implemented in a number of freely available codes, making it a widely used tool in the study of rigid body dynamics.



One of the key advantages of the HEOM method is its flexibility. It allows for the incorporation of various external forces and torques, making it applicable to a wide range of systems. Additionally, the HEOM method can be used to study the dynamics of both simple and complex rigid bodies, making it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers.



### Subsection: 19.3c Challenges in Plane-motion Dynamics



While the HEOM method is a powerful tool for modeling the dynamics of rigid bodies, there are still challenges that must be addressed. One of the main challenges is the computational complexity of the HEOM equations. As the number of variables and parameters increases, the equations become more complex and difficult to solve. This can make it challenging to analyze and predict the behavior of a rigid body in real-time.



Another challenge is the accuracy of the measurements used in the HEOM equations. As mentioned earlier, obtaining precise measurements of a rigid body's position, velocity, and acceleration can be difficult due to external disturbances and sensor noise. This can lead to errors in the equations and affect the accuracy of our predictions.



In addition, the HEOM method assumes that the rigid body is in continuous motion. However, in reality, there may be instances where the rigid body experiences sudden changes in motion, such as collisions or impacts. These discontinuities can make it challenging to accurately model the dynamics of the rigid body.



Despite these challenges, the HEOM method remains a valuable tool for studying the dynamics of rigid bodies. By understanding and addressing these challenges, we can continue to improve our understanding and control of these complex systems.

### Subsection: 20.1b Equations of Motion for Two-Degree-of-Freedom Systems



In 2.003, we learned how to derive the equations of motion for single-degree-of-freedom systems. In this course, we will extend that knowledge to two-degree-of-freedom systems. These systems have two independent degrees of freedom, meaning they require two coordinates to fully describe their motion.



To derive the equations of motion for a two-degree-of-freedom system, we use the principle of virtual work. This principle states that the virtual work done by all external forces acting on a system must be equal to the virtual work done by the internal forces. By applying this principle, we can obtain a set of coupled differential equations that describe the motion of the system.



The equations of motion for a two-degree-of-freedom system can be written in matrix form as:



$$

M\ddot{q} + C\dot{q} + Kq = F

### Section: 20.2 Plane-motion Kinematics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection: 20.2a Understanding Plane-motion Kinematics



In this section, we will build upon the concepts covered in 2.003 and apply them to the study of two-degree-of-freedom systems. Specifically, we will focus on the plane-motion kinematics of rigid bodies, which is essential for understanding the behavior of these systems.



#### 20.2a Overview of Plane-motion Kinematics



Plane-motion kinematics deals with the motion of rigid bodies in a two-dimensional plane. It is a fundamental concept in dynamics and control, as it allows us to analyze the motion of objects without considering the internal forces and deformations within the body.



The motion of a rigid body can be described by its position, velocity, and acceleration. These quantities are related through the equations of motion, which are derived from Newton's laws of motion. In the case of plane-motion, these equations can be simplified to only consider motion in two dimensions.



One important concept in plane-motion kinematics is the kinematic chain, which is a series of rigid bodies connected by joints. The motion of each body in the chain is dependent on the motion of the previous body, and this relationship can be described using kinematic equations.



Another important aspect of plane-motion kinematics is the concept of degrees of freedom. A rigid body in a two-dimensional plane has three degrees of freedom, which can be described by the position and orientation of the body. However, in a two-degree-of-freedom system, there are only two independent degrees of freedom, which can be described by two generalized coordinates.



#### 20.2b Kinematic Equations for Two-Degree-of-Freedom Systems



To understand the motion of a two-degree-of-freedom system, we must first define the generalized coordinates. These coordinates represent the independent degrees of freedom of the system and can be chosen based on the geometry and constraints of the system.



Once the generalized coordinates are defined, we can derive the kinematic equations for the system. These equations describe the relationship between the generalized coordinates, velocities, and accelerations of the system. They are essential for understanding the motion of the system and can be used to derive the equations of motion.



#### 20.2c Applications of Plane-motion Kinematics



The concepts of plane-motion kinematics have many practical applications in engineering and physics. For example, they are used in the design and analysis of mechanical systems, such as robots and vehicles. They are also essential for understanding the motion of particles and rigid bodies in fluid mechanics.



In addition, plane-motion kinematics is crucial for the study of vibrations in two-degree-of-freedom systems. By understanding the kinematics of the system, we can analyze the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the system, which are important for designing control strategies to mitigate vibrations.



#### 20.2d Conclusion



In this section, we have provided an overview of plane-motion kinematics and its importance in the study of two-degree-of-freedom systems. We have discussed the kinematic equations and their applications in engineering and physics. In the next section, we will apply these concepts to the study of vibrations in two-degree-of-freedom systems.

In the previous section, we discussed the basics of plane-motion kinematics and its importance in understanding the behavior of two-degree-of-freedom systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of plane-motion kinematics and how it can be used to analyze and model the dynamics of various systems.



#### 20.2b.1 Visualizing the Rotation of a Spacecraft in Orbit



One of the applications of plane-motion kinematics is in visualizing the rotation of a spacecraft in orbit. This is where Poinsot's construction comes into play. Poinsot's construction is a graphical method for representing the rotation of a rigid body in a two-dimensional plane. It involves drawing an ellipse, known as Poinsot's ellipsoid, which represents the orientation of the body at any given time.



This application is particularly useful in the field of aerospace engineering, where understanding the rotation of spacecraft is crucial for their control and stability. By using Poinsot's construction, engineers can visualize and analyze the motion of a spacecraft in orbit, making it easier to design control systems and predict its behavior.



#### 20.2b.2 Maintaining the Extent of a Moving Set of Points



Another application of plane-motion kinematics is in maintaining the extent of a moving set of points. This is a common problem in factory automation, where a set of points on a moving object must be kept within a certain distance from each other. This can be achieved by using Poinsot's construction to analyze the motion of the object and design control systems to maintain the desired extent.



#### 20.2b.3 Modeling the Motion of a Hispano-Suiza 12M Engine



The Hispano-Suiza 12M engine is a classic example of a two-degree-of-freedom system. It is a V12 aircraft engine that was widely used in the 1930s. By applying plane-motion kinematics, we can model the motion of this engine and analyze its behavior. This can help us understand the dynamics of the engine and make improvements to its design.



#### 20.2b.4 Implementing the HEOM Method for Dynamics and Control



The HEOM (Hierarchical Equations of Motion) method is a popular technique for solving the equations of motion for complex systems. It is based on the concept of plane-motion kinematics and is implemented in various codes, including a version for GPUs developed by David Wilkins and Nike Dattani. This method provides a flexible and efficient way to analyze the dynamics and control of complex systems.



#### 20.2b.5 Generalizing to Continuous-time Extended Kalman Filter



The continuous-time extended Kalman filter is a generalization of the discrete-time extended Kalman filter, which is commonly used in control systems. It is based on the concept of plane-motion kinematics and is used to estimate the state of a system based on noisy measurements. By understanding the kinematics of a system, we can derive the equations for the continuous-time extended Kalman filter and use it to improve the accuracy of our control systems.



In conclusion, plane-motion kinematics is a fundamental concept in dynamics and control, and it has various applications in different fields. By understanding the kinematics of a system, we can model its behavior and design control systems to achieve desired outcomes. This makes it an essential tool for engineers and scientists working with two-degree-of-freedom systems.

One of the main challenges in using plane-motion kinematics is dealing with nonlinearities in the system. Nonlinearities can arise due to various factors such as friction, damping, and external forces. These nonlinearities can significantly affect the behavior of the system and make it difficult to accurately model and predict its dynamics.



To address this challenge, various techniques such as linearization and numerical methods can be used. Linearization involves approximating the nonlinear system with a linear one, making it easier to analyze and model.

Multibody dynamics involves modeling the system as a collection of interconnected rigid bodies, allowing for a more accurate representation of its dynamics. Finite element analysis, on the other hand, involves dividing the system into smaller elements and using numerical methods to solve for the motion of each element, taking into account its complex geometry.



#### 20.2c.3 Uncertainties in Parameters and Initial Conditions



Finally, another challenge in using plane-motion kinematics is dealing with uncertainties in the parameters and initial conditions of the system. In real-world applications, it is often difficult to accurately measure or determine these values, leading to errors in the model and predictions.



To address this challenge, sensitivity analysis and robust control techniques can be used. Sensitivity analysis involves studying the effect of uncertainties in the parameters and initial conditions on the behavior of the system. Robust control techniques, on the other hand, involve designing control systems that can handle these uncertainties and still maintain stability and performance.



In conclusion, while plane-motion kinematics is a powerful tool for analyzing and modeling the dynamics of two-degree-of-freedom systems, it is not without its challenges.

## Chapter 20: Vibrations of Two-Degree-of-Freedom Systems:



### Section: 20.3 Plane-motion Dynamics of Rigid Bodies:



### Subsection (optional): 20.3c Challenges in Plane-motion Dynamics



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of plane-motion dynamics of rigid bodies and how they can be used to model the behavior of two-degree-of-freedom systems. However, as with any mathematical model, there are certain challenges that must be addressed in order to accurately represent real-world systems. In this subsection, we will explore some of the challenges that arise in plane-motion dynamics and how they can be overcome.



#### 20.3c.1 Nonlinearities



One of the main challenges in plane-motion dynamics is the presence of nonlinearities in the system. Nonlinearities can arise from various sources, such as friction, damping, and external forces. These nonlinearities can significantly affect the behavior of the system and make it difficult to accurately predict its motion.



To overcome this challenge, various techniques have been developed, such as linearization and numerical methods. Linearization involves approximating the nonlinear equations of motion with linear equations, which can be solved using standard techniques. Numerical methods, on the other hand, involve using computer algorithms to solve the nonlinear equations of motion directly. Both of these methods have their advantages and limitations, and the choice of method depends on the specific system being modeled.



#### 20.3c.2 Uncertainties



Another challenge in plane-motion dynamics is dealing with uncertainties in the system. Uncertainties can arise from various sources, such as measurement errors, modeling errors, and external disturbances. These uncertainties can significantly affect the accuracy of the model and make it difficult to predict the behavior of the system.



To address this challenge, various techniques have been developed, such as robust control and adaptive control. Robust control involves designing controllers that can handle uncertainties and disturbances in the system. Adaptive control, on the other hand, involves continuously updating the model based on new information to improve its accuracy. Both of these techniques have been successfully applied in various fields, such as aerospace engineering and robotics.



#### 20.3c.3 Coupling Effects



In some systems, the motion of one degree of freedom can affect the motion of the other degree of freedom. This is known as coupling effects and can significantly complicate the equations of motion. These effects can arise from various sources, such as structural flexibility and external forces.



To address this challenge, various techniques have been developed, such as modal analysis and decoupling methods. Modal analysis involves decomposing the system into its individual modes of vibration, which can then be analyzed separately. Decoupling methods involve designing controllers that can decouple the two degrees of freedom, allowing for independent control of each degree of freedom. Both of these techniques have been successfully applied in various fields, such as control systems and biomechanics.



In conclusion, while plane-motion dynamics provides a powerful tool for modeling the behavior of two-degree-of-freedom systems, it is important to be aware of the challenges that can arise and the techniques that can be used to overcome them.
