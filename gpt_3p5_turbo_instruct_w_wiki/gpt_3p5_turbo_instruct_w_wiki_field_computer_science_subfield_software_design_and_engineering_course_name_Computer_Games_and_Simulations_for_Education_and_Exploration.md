# Computer Games and Simulations for Education and Exploration



## Chapter 1: Introduction



### Section 1.1: Importance of Educational Games



#### Subsection 1.1a: Introduction to Educational Games



In today's digital age, computer games and simulations have become increasingly popular as tools for education and exploration. These interactive digital experiences have the ability to engage and motivate learners in ways that traditional methods may not. As educators, governments, and parents realize the psychological need and benefits that gaming has on learning, this educational tool has become mainstream.



Educational games are games explicitly designed with educational purposes, or which have incidental or secondary educational value. They can take various forms such as board, card, and video games. These games are designed to help people learn about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand a historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play.



Games are interactive play that teach goals, rules, adaptation, problem solving, interaction, all represented as a story. They satisfy a fundamental need to learn by providing enjoyment, passionate involvement, structure, motivation, ego gratification, adrenaline, creativity, social interaction, and emotion in the game itself while the learning takes place.



## Video Games



With the increase and availability of technological devices, there has been a shift in what types of games people play. Video or electronic gaming has become more widely used than traditional board games. Barab (2009) defines conceptual play as "a state of engagement that involves (a) projection into the role of character who, (b) engaged in a partly fictional problem context, (c) must apply conceptual understandings to make sense of, and ultimately, transform the context". The goal of such play spaces is to have the "gamer" engage in the narrative while learning cognitive and social skills. The ability to immerse oneself in the gaming process facilitates "empathetic embodiment" which occurs when a player learns to identify with the character they have chosen for the game and the virtual environment of the game (Barab, 2009).



Educational video games have been divided into two major categories. "Edutainment" games are those that are designed primarily for entertainment but also have some educational value. On the other hand, "serious games" are explicitly designed for educational purposes and have a primary focus on learning. Both types of games have been shown to have positive effects on learning and engagement.



In this chapter, we will explore the use of computer games and simulations in education and how they can be utilized for exploration and learning. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of using these tools, as well as provide examples of successful implementations in various fields. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the potential of computer games and simulations in education and exploration.

### Section 2.1: MDA Framework for Game Design



The MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) framework for game design is a widely used approach to understanding and analyzing the elements of a game. Developed by Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, and Robert Zubek in 2004, the MDA framework breaks down a game into three components: mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics. In this section, we will explore the role of mechanics in game design and how they can be utilized in educational and exploratory settings.



#### 2.1a Mechanics in Game Design



Mechanics refer to the rules and systems that govern the behavior of a game. They are the building blocks of a game and determine what actions are possible for the player. Mechanics can include things like movement, combat, resource management, and puzzle solving. In the context of educational and exploratory games, mechanics can also include learning objectives and tasks that promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills.



One of the key benefits of using commercial off the shelf games in education is the already established mechanics that have been thoroughly tested and refined by game developers. This allows educators to focus on incorporating these mechanics into their curriculum rather than spending time and resources on developing a game from scratch. However, it is important to carefully select games that align with the learning objectives and desired outcomes of the curriculum.



Moreover, the mechanics of a game can also be modified or adapted to better suit the educational or exploratory goals. This can be done through the use of mods or custom game modes, which allow for a more tailored and targeted learning experience. For example, a history teacher may use a strategy game like Civilization to teach students about different civilizations and their interactions, but modify the game to focus on a specific time period or event.



In addition to providing a structured and engaging learning experience, mechanics in game design also promote the development of skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. By presenting players with challenges and obstacles, games encourage them to think creatively and strategically in order to progress and succeed. This can be particularly beneficial in educational settings, where students are often required to think outside the box and apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.



In conclusion, mechanics play a crucial role in game design and can be effectively utilized in educational and exploratory settings. By understanding and incorporating the mechanics of commercial off the shelf games, educators can create engaging and immersive learning experiences that promote the development of important skills and knowledge.

### Section 2.1: MDA Framework for Game Design



The MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) framework for game design is a widely used approach to understanding and analyzing the elements of a game. Developed by Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, and Robert Zubek in 2004, the MDA framework breaks down a game into three components: mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics. In this section, we will explore the role of dynamics in game design and how they can be utilized in educational and exploratory settings.



#### 2.1b Dynamics in Game Design



Dynamics refer to the emergent behavior and interactions that arise from the mechanics of a game. They are the result of player actions and decisions within the game world. Dynamics can include things like competition, cooperation, and exploration. In the context of educational and exploratory games, dynamics can also include critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making.



One of the key benefits of using commercial off the shelf games in education is the already established dynamics that have been thoroughly tested and refined by game developers. This allows educators to focus on incorporating these dynamics into their curriculum rather than spending time and resources on developing a game from scratch. However, it is important to carefully select games that align with the learning objectives and desired outcomes of the curriculum.



Moreover, the dynamics of a game can also be modified or adapted to better suit the educational or exploratory goals. This can be done through the use of mods or custom game modes, which allow for a more tailored and targeted learning experience. For example, a science teacher may use a simulation game like Kerbal Space Program to teach students about physics and engineering, but modify the game to focus on specific concepts or challenges.



From the perspective of the designer, the mechanics of a game are the building blocks that generate the dynamics, which in turn generate the aesthetics. This relationship poses a challenge for the game designer as they are only able to influence the mechanics and only through them can meaningful dynamics and aesthetics be produced for the player.



On the other hand, from the perspective of the player, they experience the game through the aesthetics, which are provided by the game dynamics, which emerge from the mechanics. This highlights the importance of carefully designing and balancing the mechanics of a game to create engaging and meaningful dynamics for the player.



## Criticism of the MDA Framework



Despite its popularity, the original MDA framework has been criticized for several potential weaknesses. One criticism is that the eight kinds of fun comprise a rather arbitrary list of emotional targets, lacking fundamentals and not fully exploring all types of emotional responses. Additionally, the framework has been challenged for neglecting many design aspects of games while focusing too much on game mechanics, making it less suitable for all types of games, including particularly gamified content or any type of experience-oriented games.



To address these criticisms, the MDA framework has been expanded and modified over the years to include additional elements such as narrative and player experience. However, it remains a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing the components of a game and their impact on the player's experience. As such, it can be a useful framework for designing educational and exploratory games that effectively engage and educate players.

Visual effects can also improve game feel by introducing extra spectacle and dazzling the player. Vivid colors and bright aesthetics can make a game feel alive, and adding effects like bright flashes, sparks, explosions, debris, and camera shake enhances the impact of events in the game.



### Sound Aesthetics



Sound effects are another important aspect of aesthetics in game design. They emphasize the interactions between objects in the game and can greatly enhance the overall game feel. Weak or quiet sound effects can make game objects feel weak and less impactful, while high-quality and appropriate sound effects can make the game more engaging and immersive.



Music also plays a significant role in game aesthetics. The main purpose of game music is to reinforce the main mood or tone of the game. For example, action games generally use loud and bombastic scores to emphasize the feeling of power and triumph, while horror games use subtle, tense music with loud spikes to create moments of intensity.



### Metaphor in Game Design



Metaphor in game design refers to how the game mechanics relate to the game's theme. When players encounter familiar concepts and objects in a game, they bring preconceived notions of how those things should behave. This can enhance the player's understanding and engagement with the game. For instance, a realistic physics engine in a game about space exploration can help players better understand the principles of gravity and motion.



In educational and exploratory games, the use of metaphor can be particularly effective in teaching complex concepts and ideas. By incorporating familiar elements and mechanics, players can better grasp and apply the knowledge being presented in the game.



In conclusion, aesthetics play a crucial role in game design, especially in the context of computer games and simulations for education and exploration. By carefully considering and incorporating visual and sound aesthetics, as well as utilizing metaphor, game designers can create engaging and immersive experiences that enhance learning and exploration.

Player engagement and motivation are crucial elements in the success of digital games. Without these, players may quickly lose interest and abandon the game. In this section, we will explore the concept of player engagement and motivation and how it can be understood and utilized in the design of digital games.



#### 5.3a Understanding Player Engagement in Digital Games



Player engagement can be defined as the level of involvement and interest a player has in a game. It is a multidimensional concept that encompasses cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects. In other words, it is not just about how much a player enjoys a game, but also how much they think about it and how likely they are to continue playing.



One way to understand player engagement is through the lens of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). According to SDT, there are three basic psychological needs that must be satisfied for individuals to be intrinsically motivated and engaged in an activity: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Autonomy refers to the need for individuals to feel in control of their own actions and decisions. Competence refers to the need for individuals to feel capable and successful in their actions. Relatedness refers to the need for individuals to feel connected to others and have a sense of belonging.



In the context of digital games, these needs can be satisfied through various game design elements. For example, providing players with choices and agency in the game can fulfill their need for autonomy. Including challenges and opportunities for skill development can fulfill their need for competence. And incorporating social features and multiplayer options can fulfill their need for relatedness.



Another important aspect of player engagement is the concept of flow. Flow is a state of complete immersion and focus in an activity, where individuals are fully engaged and lose track of time. In the context of digital games, flow can be achieved through a balance of challenge and skill. If a game is too easy, players may become bored and disengaged. On the other hand, if a game is too difficult, players may become frustrated and give up. Therefore, it is important for game designers to carefully consider the level of challenge in their games to promote flow and engagement.



In addition to understanding the factors that contribute to player engagement, it is also important to consider the potential negative effects of excessive gameplay. While digital games can be a valuable tool for education and exploration, they can also lead to addiction and negative impacts on mental health if not used in moderation. Therefore, it is important for game designers to consider responsible gameplay and incorporate features that promote breaks and healthy habits.



In conclusion, understanding player engagement and motivation is crucial for the design of successful digital games. By satisfying basic psychological needs, promoting flow, and considering responsible gameplay, game designers can create engaging and motivating experiences for players.

# Game Studies



### Cognitive Benefits



The psychological research into games has yielded theories on how playing video games may be advantageous for both children and for adults. Some theories claim that video games in fact help improve cognitive abilities rather than impede their development. These improvement theories include the improvement of visual contrast sensitivity. Other developments include the ability to locate something specific among various impediments. This is primarily done in first-person shooter games where the protagonist must look at everything in a first person view while playing. By doing this they increase their spatial attention due to having to locate something among an area of diversions. These games place the player in a high intensity environment where the player must remain observant of their surroundings in order to achieve their goal, e.g., shooting an enemy player, while impediments obstruct their gameplay in the virtual world.



Another cognitive enhancement provided by playing video games would be the improvement of brain functioning speed. This happens as the player is immersed in an unendingly changing environment where they are required to constantly think and problem solve while playing in order to do well in the game. This constant problem solving forces the brain to constantly run and so the speed of thought is sharpened greatly, because the need to think quickly is required to succeed. The attention span of the player is also benefited. High action video games, such as fighting or racing games, require the user's constant attention and in the process the skill of concentration is sharpened.



The overcoming of the condition known as dyslexia is also considered an improvement due to the continuous utilization of controllers for the video games. This continuous process helps to train the users to overcome their condition which impedes in their abilities of interpretation. The ability of hand-eye coordination is also improved through the use of controllers, as players must quickly and accurately respond to on-screen prompts and actions.

### Section: 10.1 Designing Games for Visual Learners:



Visual learners make up a significant portion of the population, and it is essential to cater to their needs in educational games and simulations. These learners process information best through visual aids, such as images, diagrams, and videos. In this section, we will discuss the design considerations for creating games that are suitable for visual learners.



#### 10.1a Understanding the Needs of Visual Learners



Before delving into the design aspects, it is crucial to understand the needs of visual learners. These learners have a strong preference for visual aids and tend to process information in a bottom-up manner. This means that they focus on the details and then piece them together to form a bigger picture. As a result, they may be easily distracted by visually compelling elements in a game or simulation, even if they are not relevant to the learning task.



Furthermore, visual learners may struggle with abstract concepts and benefit from concrete and visual representations. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate visual aids that accurately represent the content being taught. This can include diagrams, animations, and interactive visuals that allow learners to manipulate and explore the concepts.

# Educational animation



## Dynamic contrast



The correspondence problems due to perceptual characteristics of a display are compounded when we go from a static to an animated graphic. Because of their dynamic character, educational animations introduce a further challenge to information extraction beyond those found with static graphics. Certain aspects of a display that changes over time have the potential to capture learner attention. If there is sufficient "dynamic contrast" between one or more items in the display and their surroundings, the effect can be very compelling in a perceptual sense. It seems that a fundamental level, our perceptual system is attuned to detect and follow such changes, irrespective of their importance in terms of the subject matter. As with static displays discussed above, items that are perceptually compelling (in this case because of their dynamic character) may not necessarily be of great thematic relevance to the given learning task. The big orange float in the accompanying animation is far more perceptible than the small grey air valve because of both its visuospatial characteristics, and its high level of dynamic contrast with the rest of the display.



The misleading effects of the dynamic contrast are likely to be particularly problematic for learners who lack background knowledge in the content domain depicted in an animation. These learners can be largely in the thrall of the animation's raw perceptual effects and so tend to process the presented information in a bottom-up manner. For example, their attention within the display is likely to be directed to items that have conspicuous dynamic characteristics. As a result, there is a danger that they will attend to unimportant information merely because it is perceptually compelling. However, learners who already have considerable domain specific background knowledge are likely to be less influenced by perception alone. This is because their attention is also directed to a consid

In this subsection, we will explore different methods for evaluating the effectiveness of games for language arts.



One way to evaluate the effectiveness of games for language arts is through pre- and post-game assessments. This involves administering a language arts assessment to students before and after playing the game. By comparing the results, educators can determine if the game had a positive impact on students' language skills. This method allows for a direct measurement of the game's effectiveness and can provide valuable data for future game design.



Another method for evaluating the effectiveness of games for language arts is through observation and feedback. Educators can observe students playing the game and take note of their language skills and engagement levels. Additionally, students can provide feedback on their experience with the game, including what they learned and how it helped them improve their language skills. This method allows for a more qualitative assessment and can provide insights into the game's strengths and weaknesses.



In addition to these methods, it is also important to consider the principles of effective game design for language arts. As mentioned in the previous section, incorporating procedural rhetoric and multimodal interaction can enhance the effectiveness of games for language arts. Therefore, when evaluating the effectiveness of a game, it is important to consider how well these principles were incorporated and how they contributed to the overall learning experience.



Furthermore, it is important to consider individual variation in second-language acquisition when evaluating the effectiveness of games for language arts. As discussed in the related context, learners from different cultures may use strategies in different ways, and there may be differences in strategy use between male and female learners. Therefore, it is important to take into account these individual differences when evaluating the effectiveness of games for language arts.



In conclusion, evaluating the effectiveness of games for language arts is crucial in determining their impact on language learning and teaching. By using a combination of methods, considering the principles of effective game design, and taking into account individual variation, educators can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of these games and make informed decisions for future game design.

### Section: 11.4 Designing Games for Social Studies:



### Subsection (optional): 11.4a Understanding the Needs of Social Studies Learners



In order to effectively design games for social studies, it is important to understand the needs of social studies learners. Social studies is a subject that encompasses a wide range of topics, including history, geography, economics, civics, and political science. Therefore, social studies learners must have a strong foundation in these core areas in order to fully engage with the subject.



One of the key needs of social studies learners is a strong understanding of culture and diversity. This theme is essential in social studies as it allows learners to experience different cultures and perspectives, promoting a greater understanding and appreciation for diversity. In designing games for social studies, it is important to incorporate elements of multiculturalism and provide opportunities for learners to explore and understand different cultures.



Another important need of social studies learners is the ability to understand and analyze the past. This includes examining historical events and their impact on the development of the current world. By understanding the beliefs and values of the past, learners can apply them to the present and develop critical thinking and inquiry skills. Games for social studies should incorporate elements of history and provide opportunities for learners to analyze and interpret historical events.



In addition, social studies learners need to have a strong understanding of people, places, and the environment. This theme focuses on understanding one's own identity and the world around them. Games for social studies should provide opportunities for learners to explore different places and perspectives, as well as develop spatial and geographic skills.



When designing games for social studies, it is important to consider the ten themes of social studies outlined by the National Council for the Social Studies. These themes provide a framework for understanding the needs of social studies learners and should be incorporated into game design. By understanding the needs of social studies learners and incorporating these themes into game design, educators can create engaging and effective games for social studies education.

### Subsection (optional): 11.4b Incorporating Technology in Social Studies Games



In today's digital age, technology has become an integral part of education. This is especially true for social studies, where technology can enhance the learning experience and engage students in a more interactive and immersive way. In this subsection, we will explore the benefits of incorporating technology in social studies games and provide some examples of how it can be done effectively.



One of the main benefits of using technology in social studies games is the ability to create a more immersive and interactive learning experience. With the use of virtual reality, students can explore historical sites and events in a more realistic and engaging way. For example, a game could allow students to virtually visit the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu or experience the signing of the Declaration of Independence. This not only makes learning more fun and engaging, but also helps students develop a deeper understanding and connection to the subject matter.



Another benefit of incorporating technology in social studies games is the ability to personalize the learning experience for students. With the use of artificial intelligence and adaptive learning algorithms, games can be tailored to each student's individual needs and learning style. This allows for a more personalized and effective learning experience, as students can progress at their own pace and receive targeted feedback and support.



Furthermore, technology can also provide opportunities for collaboration and communication among students. With the use of online platforms and multiplayer games, students can work together to solve problems and complete tasks related to social studies topics. This not only promotes teamwork and communication skills, but also allows for a more diverse and global perspective as students can collaborate with peers from different backgrounds and cultures.



Some examples of successful incorporation of technology in social studies games include "Mission US" and "Civilization." "Mission US" is a series of interactive games that allow students to experience different periods of American history, such as the American Revolution and the Great Depression. "Civilization" is a strategy game that allows players to build and manage their own civilization, while also learning about different historical events and leaders.



In conclusion, incorporating technology in social studies games can greatly enhance the learning experience for students. It allows for a more immersive and personalized approach to learning, as well as promoting collaboration and communication skills. As technology continues to advance, the possibilities for incorporating it in social studies games are endless, making it an exciting and effective tool for education and exploration.
