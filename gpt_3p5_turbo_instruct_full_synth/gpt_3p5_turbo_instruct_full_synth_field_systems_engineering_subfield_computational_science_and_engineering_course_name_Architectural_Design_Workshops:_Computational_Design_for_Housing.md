# Computational Design for Housing: A Comprehensive Guide":





## Foreward



Welcome to "Computational Design for Housing: A Comprehensive Guide". In this book, we will explore the intersection of design and technology, specifically in the context of housing. As our world becomes increasingly digital and interconnected, it is important for us to understand how computational tools can enhance and transform the way we design and build our homes.



The use of technology in architecture is not a new concept. In fact, it has been a part of the industry for decades, with the introduction of computer-aided design (CAD) software in the 1960s. However, with the rise of open-source architecture and the development of new parametric design tools, we are now witnessing a new era of design possibilities.



One of the key themes of this book is the idea of mass customization. With the help of algorithms and parametric design tools, we are able to create unique and personalized designs at a fraction of the cost and time it would have taken in the past. This not only allows for greater creativity and flexibility in design, but also empowers individuals to be active participants in the design process.



But as with any new technology, there are also criticisms and concerns. Some argue that the use of these advanced design tools may create a divide between those who have access to them and those who do not. This is where the concept of P2P Urbanism comes in. By promoting low-tech design solutions and open-source platforms, we can bridge this gap and make design knowledge accessible to all.



In this book, we will also explore the role of collaboration and cross-disciplinary integration in the design process. With the help of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and other collaboration tools, we can break down traditional silos and work together to create more efficient and sustainable designs.



Lastly, we will delve into the exciting world of rapid prototyping and 3D printing, and how these technologies are revolutionizing the way we produce physical objects, even at an architectural scale. This opens up endless possibilities for experimentation and innovation in the field of housing design.



I hope this book will serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in the intersection of design and technology in the context of housing. Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply curious about the future of housing, I believe you will find valuable insights and inspiration within these pages.



Let us embark on this journey together and explore the endless possibilities of computational design for housing.

Another useful technique is generative design, which uses algorithms to generate multiple design options based on a set of constraints and objectives. This allows for a more exploratory and iterative design process, where the designer can evaluate a large number of design options and select the most suitable one.



Optimization algorithms are also commonly used in computational design to find the best solution to a design problem. These algorithms use mathematical optimization techniques to find the optimal values for a set of design parameters. For example, in a housing project, the designer can use optimization algorithms to determine the most cost-effective and energy-efficient building materials.



In addition to these tools and techniques, the paper also emphasizes the importance of site analysis in the design process. By using computational tools, designers can analyze various site factors such as topography, climate, and site constraints to inform the design. This ensures that the design is not only suitable for the site but also takes advantage of its unique features to create a more sustainable and efficient design.



To further illustrate the application of computational design, the paper provides case studies and examples of successful projects. These examples showcase the potential of computational design in creating innovative and efficient housing designs.

### Section: 4.1 Understanding 3D Shape Grammars



Shape grammars are a powerful tool for generating designs in 3D. They allow for the creation of complex and varied designs that adhere to a set of rules and constraints. In this section, we will explore the key concepts of 3D shape grammars and how they differ from 2D shape grammars.



#### 4.1a Basic Principles of 3D Shape Grammars



The basic principles of 3D shape grammars are similar to those of 2D shape grammars. They involve the use of a set of rules and constraints to generate designs. However, in 3D shape grammars, the rules and constraints are applied in three dimensions, allowing for more complex and varied designs.



One of the key principles of 3D shape grammars is the use of hierarchical structures. This means that designs are generated by breaking them down into smaller components, which are then combined to create the final design. This allows for a more systematic and efficient approach to design generation.



Another important principle is the use of shape rules. These rules define the relationships between different components of a design and how they can be combined to create new designs. They also specify the constraints that must be followed in order to generate valid designs.



#### 4.1b Applications of 3D Shape Grammars in Housing Design



The use of 3D shape grammars in housing design has revolutionized the way we think about and approach the design process. It allows for the creation of highly complex and innovative designs that are tailored to specific constraints and requirements.



One of the main applications of 3D shape grammars in housing design is the generation of mass-customized designs. This means that a set of rules and constraints can be used to generate a large number of unique designs that meet the needs and preferences of individual clients. This allows for a more personalized and efficient approach to housing design.



Another application is the use of 3D shape grammars in sustainable design. By incorporating constraints related to energy efficiency, material usage, and environmental impact, 3D shape grammars can be used to generate designs that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also environmentally friendly.



### Subsection: 4.1c Examples of 3D Shape Grammars



To better understand the potential of 3D shape grammars in housing design, let's take a look at some examples of their application.



One example is the work of architect Michael Hansmeyer, who used 3D shape grammars to generate a series of highly intricate and complex columns for a building in Dubai. By applying a set of rules and constraints, he was able to create designs that were not only visually stunning but also structurally sound.



Another example is the use of 3D shape grammars in the design of modular housing units. By using a set of rules and constraints, designers can generate a variety of modular units that can be combined to create different configurations, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in housing design.



### Conclusion

### Section: 4.2 Practice 3D Grammars by Hand



In the previous section, we discussed the basic principles of shape grammars and how they can be applied to housing design. Now, let's put that knowledge into practice by learning how to create 3D shape grammars by hand.



#### 4.2b Practicing 3D Grammars



Before we dive into creating 3D shape grammars, it is important to understand the basic components of a shape grammar. These include:



- Symbols: These are the basic building blocks of a shape grammar and represent the different elements that can be used in a design.

- Rules: These define how the symbols can be combined and arranged to create a design.

- Constraints: These are conditions that must be met in order for a design to be considered valid.



To practice creating 3D shape grammars, we will use a simple example of designing a house. Let's start by defining our symbols:



- Wall (W)

- Window (win)

- Door (d)

- Roof (r)



Next, we will define our rules:



1. W -> W W W W: This rule allows for the creation of a straight wall by repeating the symbol four times.

2. W -> W win W: This rule allows for the insertion of a window in the middle of a wall.

3. W -> d W: This rule allows for the insertion of a door at the beginning of a wall.

4. W -> r W: This rule allows for the addition of a roof on top of a wall.



Finally, we will define our constraints:



- The total number of walls must be between 3 and 5.

- The number of windows must be less than or equal to the number of walls.

- The number of doors must be less than or equal to the number of walls.

- The roof must cover the entire house.



Using these rules and constraints, we can now create a variety of designs for our house. By following the rules and ensuring that the constraints are met, we can generate unique and interesting designs.



Practicing 3D shape grammars by hand allows us to better understand the principles behind this design approach and how it can be applied to housing design. It also helps us to develop our creativity and problem-solving skills, which are essential in the field of architecture and design.



### Conclusion



In this section, we learned how to practice 3D shape grammars by hand. By understanding the basic components of a shape grammar and following the rules and constraints, we can create a wide range of designs for housing. This exercise also helps us to develop our skills and gain a deeper understanding of the principles behind shape grammars in 3D. In the next section, we will explore how we can use computational tools to automate the process of creating 3D shape grammars.

In addition, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to practice 3D grammars by hand, including exercises and examples for readers to follow along.



### Section: 4.2 Practice 3D Grammars by Hand



In the previous section, we discussed the basic principles of shape grammars and their application in housing design. Now, we will provide a hands-on approach to practicing 3D grammars. This section is designed for readers to gain a better understanding of how shape grammars work and how they can be used to generate designs.



#### 4.2a Understanding the Rules and Constraints



Before we can start practicing 3D grammars, it is important to understand the rules and constraints that govern them. As mentioned earlier, shape grammars are based on a set of rules and constraints that dictate the generation of designs. These rules and constraints can be thought of as a language that the designer uses to communicate with the computer.



The rules in a shape grammar are typically represented in the form of production rules, which consist of a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS). The LHS represents the initial shape or design, while the RHS represents the new shape or design that is generated by applying the rule. The constraints, on the other hand, define the limitations or conditions that must be met for a rule to be applied.



#### 4.2b Practicing 3D Grammars by Hand



To practice 3D grammars by hand, we will use a simple example of a house design. Let's say we want to generate a house with a rectangular base and a triangular roof. We can represent this design using the following production rule:



$$
LHS: Rectangle \rightarrow RHS: Rectangle + Triangle
$$



This rule states that a rectangle can be transformed into a rectangle and a triangle. However, we also need to define the constraints for this rule. For our example, we will set the constraint that the triangle must be placed on top of the rectangle.



Now, let's say we want to generate a more complex design with multiple levels and a different roof shape. We can add another production rule to our grammar:



$$
LHS: Rectangle + Triangle \rightarrow RHS: Rectangle + Triangle + Square
$$



This rule states that a rectangle and a triangle can be transformed into a rectangle, a triangle, and a square. We can also add constraints to this rule, such as the square must be placed on top of the triangle.



By following these rules and constraints, we can continue to generate more complex designs by hand. This exercise allows us to better understand how shape grammars work and how they can be used to create a variety of designs.



### Subsection: 4.2c Review and Feedback on 3D Grammar Practice



After practicing 3D grammars by hand, it is important to review and reflect on the process. This will help us identify any challenges or limitations we encountered and how we can improve our understanding and application of shape grammars.



One common challenge when practicing 3D grammars by hand is keeping track of the rules and constraints. It can be easy to make mistakes or forget a constraint, which can lead to incorrect designs. To overcome this challenge, it is important to carefully define and document the rules and constraints before starting the exercise.



Another challenge is the limited scope of hand-drawn designs. While practicing 3D grammars by hand can be a useful exercise, it is important to note that it may not accurately reflect the capabilities of computational tools. Therefore, it is important to also practice using computational tools to fully understand the potential of shape grammars in 3D design.



In conclusion, practicing 3D grammars by hand is a valuable exercise for understanding the fundamentals of shape grammars and their application in housing design. By carefully defining rules and constraints and reflecting on the process, we can improve our understanding and application of shape grammars. However, it is important to also explore the use of computational tools to fully utilize the potential of shape grammars in 3D design.

Additionally, we explored the potential of incorporating shape grammars into parametric design processes, further enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the design.



Overall, shape grammars offer a valuable framework for computational design in the housing industry, providing designers with a structured and efficient approach to creating innovative and functional designs.

## Chapter 6: AutoGrammar Tutorial:



### Section: 6.2 Understanding Given Spatial Relations:



In the previous section, we discussed the basics of AutoGrammar and its benefits in the design process for housing. Now, we will dive deeper into the tool and explore how it understands given spatial relations.



#### 6.2a Understanding Spatial Relations



Spatial relations refer to the relationships between different elements in a design, such as the placement of walls, doors, and windows. These relationships are crucial in creating functional and aesthetically pleasing designs. AutoGrammar uses generative algorithms to understand and interpret these spatial relations, allowing for the creation of designs that meet specific requirements and goals.



One of the key aspects of understanding spatial relations in AutoGrammar is the use of parametric design. This approach allows for the creation of designs based on a set of parameters and rules, rather than fixed dimensions. This not only allows for a high level of customization but also ensures that the generated designs are optimized for specific needs.



To understand spatial relations, AutoGrammar uses a combination of geometric and topological analysis. Geometric analysis involves the use of mathematical principles to define and manipulate shapes and forms. Topological analysis, on the other hand, focuses on the relationships between these shapes and forms. By combining these two approaches, AutoGrammar can accurately interpret and generate designs based on given spatial relations.



Another important aspect of understanding spatial relations in AutoGrammar is the use of constraints. Constraints are rules that limit the design options based on specific parameters. For example, a constraint can be set to ensure that all rooms have access to natural light. By defining these constraints, designers can ensure that the generated designs meet their specific requirements and goals.



In addition to understanding spatial relations, AutoGrammar also has the ability to optimize these relationships. By defining parameters such as room size, orientation, and adjacency, designers can ensure that the generated designs are not only functional but also efficient and sustainable.



In conclusion, understanding spatial relations is a crucial aspect of using AutoGrammar in the design process for housing. By using a combination of geometric and topological analysis, along with the use of constraints, AutoGrammar can accurately interpret and generate designs that meet specific requirements and goals. This not only saves time and effort but also leads to more efficient and sustainable housing solutions.

By defining these constraints, designers can ensure that the generated designs meet their specific requirements and goals.



### Subsection: 6.2b Applying Spatial Relations in Design



Now that we have a better understanding of how AutoGrammar interprets spatial relations, let's explore how we can apply this knowledge in the design process. By using AutoGrammar, designers can create designs that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and optimized for specific needs.



One way to apply spatial relations in design is by using the concept of adjacency. Adjacency refers to the relationship between two or more elements in a design, such as the proximity of a kitchen to a dining area. By defining these relationships, designers can ensure that the generated designs are efficient and practical.



Another way to apply spatial relations is by using the concept of hierarchy. Hierarchy refers to the organization of elements in a design based on their importance or function. For example, in a house, the living room may be considered a more important space than a storage room. By defining this hierarchy, designers can create designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional.



AutoGrammar also allows for the application of spatial relations through the use of patterns. Patterns refer to the repetition of elements in a design, such as the placement of windows or the layout of rooms. By using patterns, designers can create designs that are cohesive and visually appealing.



In addition to these techniques, AutoGrammar also offers the option to incorporate user preferences and feedback in the design process. By allowing users to input their preferences and requirements, AutoGrammar can generate designs that are tailored to their specific needs.



In conclusion, understanding spatial relations is crucial in the design process, and AutoGrammar offers a powerful tool to interpret and apply these relationships in the creation of housing designs. By using a combination of parametric design, geometric and topological analysis, constraints, and user preferences, designers can create functional, aesthetically pleasing, and optimized designs for housing.

### Subsection: 6.2b Applying Spatial Relations in AutoGrammar



In this subsection, we will explore how spatial relations are applied in AutoGrammar through case studies. These case studies will provide a better understanding of how the tool interprets and generates designs based on given spatial relations.



#### 6.2c Case Studies in Spatial Relations



To demonstrate the application of spatial relations in AutoGrammar, we will look at two case studies: a single-family home and a multi-unit apartment building. In both cases, we will examine how AutoGrammar uses spatial relations to generate designs that meet specific requirements and goals.



In the case of the single-family home, the designer may have specific spatial requirements, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and living spaces. By inputting these requirements into AutoGrammar, the tool will use its generative algorithms to create a design that meets these spatial needs while also considering other factors such as natural light, ventilation, and circulation.



For the multi-unit apartment building, the designer may have different spatial requirements, such as the number of units, common areas, and parking spaces. AutoGrammar can use these requirements to generate a design that maximizes the use of space while also adhering to building codes and regulations.



Through these case studies, we can see how AutoGrammar's understanding of spatial relations allows for the creation of customized and optimized designs for different types of housing. By utilizing parametric design, geometric and topological analysis, and constraints, AutoGrammar can generate designs that meet specific spatial requirements and goals.

To apply this in practice, we will use a simple example of designing a living room. Let's say we want to create a living room with a specific size and shape, and we want to ensure that it has access to natural light. We can use AutoGrammar to generate designs that meet these requirements.



First, we need to define our parameters. In this case, our parameters would be the size and shape of the living room. We can use mathematical expressions to define these parameters, such as $L = 10$ feet for the length and $W = 8$ feet for the width. These parameters will be used by AutoGrammar to generate designs that meet these specific dimensions.



Next, we need to set our constraints. As mentioned in the previous section, constraints are rules that limit the design options based on specific parameters. In this case, our constraint would be to ensure that the living room has access to natural light. We can define this constraint as $A = 0.2LW$, where $A$ represents the area of windows in the living room. This constraint will ensure that the generated designs have enough window area to provide natural light.



Now, we can input these parameters and constraints into AutoGrammar and let it generate designs for us. AutoGrammar will use geometric and topological analysis to interpret these parameters and constraints and generate designs that meet our requirements. We can then review and select the design that best fits our needs.



In this way, AutoGrammar allows us to quickly and efficiently generate designs based on given spatial relations. This not only saves time and effort but also ensures that the designs are optimized for specific needs and goals. As we continue to practice with AutoGrammar, we will become more familiar with its capabilities and be able to use it effectively in our design process for housing.

The first step in using AutoGrammar is to define the parameters for our design. As mentioned before, these parameters will determine the size and shape of our living room. In our example, we have already defined the length and width as $L = 10$ feet and $W = 8$ feet, respectively. These values can be adjusted depending on the specific requirements of the design.



#### 6.3b.2 Step 2: Setting Constraints



Once we have defined our parameters, we need to set constraints to limit the design options. In our example, our constraint is to ensure that the living room has access to natural light. We can define this constraint as $A = 0.2LW$, where $A$ represents the area of windows in the living room. This constraint will ensure that the generated designs have enough window area to provide natural light.



#### 6.3b.3 Step 3: Generating Designs



Now that we have defined our parameters and constraints, we can input them into AutoGrammar and let it generate designs for us. AutoGrammar will use its generative algorithms to interpret the parameters and constraints and generate designs that meet these requirements. These designs can then be further refined and customized to fit the specific needs of the project.



#### 6.3b.4 Step 4: Evaluating and Refining Designs



After AutoGrammar has generated designs for us, we can evaluate them based on our design goals and make any necessary refinements. This process allows for a quick and efficient way to explore different design options and find the best solution for a given set of spatial relations.
