# Architectural Construction and Computation: Principles, Processes, and Applications":





## Foreward



Welcome to "Architectural Construction and Computation: Principles, Processes, and Applications". In this book, we will explore the intersection of architecture and technology, specifically focusing on the principles, processes, and applications of open-source architecture and computer-aided architectural design (CAAD).



The field of architecture is constantly evolving, and with the rise of technology, we are seeing a shift towards a more collaborative and iterative approach to design. The open-source hardware movement has enabled the sharing and collaboration of hardware designs, allowing for the creation of kinetic and smart environments that seamlessly integrate software, hardware, and mechanisms. This has transformed the traditional one-off, disjointed design process into an ongoing, evolutionary one, where design is a collaboration between users and designers.



With the use of sensors and data, design is no longer limited to the initial planning and construction phases. Instead, it becomes an ongoing process, with the ability to adapt and evolve over time. This is made possible by the development of open platforms and "apps" that allow for the creation of operating systems for the design, construction, and occupancy phases. As a result, we are seeing a shift towards a more holistic approach to architecture, where materials are embedded with sensors and computing capabilities, creating a world of "Spimes" as envisioned by Bruce Sterling.



One of the key tools in this evolving field is computer-aided architectural design (CAAD). This technology allows for a two-way mapping of activities and functionalities, bridging the gap between surface structures and deep structures. This mapping is crucial in understanding the design and deployment process of CAAD systems. By considering both surface and deep structures, we can create a one-to-one mapping between manual design activities and computer-based functionalities, resulting in a more efficient and effective design process.



As we delve into the principles, processes, and applications of open-source architecture and CAAD, we will also explore the advantages and challenges of these technologies. We will examine how they are transforming the field of architecture and how they can be used to create innovative and sustainable designs.



I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, architects, and anyone interested in the intersection of architecture and technology. Let us embark on this journey together and discover the endless possibilities that lie at the intersection of architectural construction and computation.

### Section: 1.1 Traditional Design Principles:



Traditional design principles are rooted in the concept of balance, which is achieved through the careful arrangement of elements within a structure. This balance can be symmetrical, where elements are mirrored on either side of a central axis, or asymmetrical, where elements are arranged in a way that creates a sense of equilibrium. Proportion is also a key principle in traditional design, as it ensures that elements are appropriately sized in relation to one another. This creates a sense of harmony and cohesion within a structure.



Another important principle in traditional design is hierarchy, which refers to the organization of elements in order of importance. This can be achieved through the use of scale, color, or placement within a structure. Hierarchy helps to guide the viewer's eye and create a sense of visual hierarchy within a design.



### Subsection: 1.1a History of Traditional Design



The history of traditional design can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as the Greeks and Romans, who used principles of balance, proportion, and hierarchy in their architectural designs. These principles were also prevalent in Gothic and Renaissance architecture, and they continue to influence modern architectural styles.



In the 20th century, traditional design principles were challenged by the emergence of modernism, which rejected the use of ornamentation and focused on functionality and simplicity. However, traditional design principles have remained relevant and have been adapted to incorporate new technologies and materials.



### Conclusion:



In this section, we have explored the key principles of traditional design, including balance, proportion, and hierarchy. We have also discussed the history of traditional design and its evolution over time.

Proportion is also a key principle in traditional design, as it ensures that elements are appropriately sized in relation to one another. This creates a sense of harmony and cohesion within the design.



#### 1.1b Principles and Elements



In addition to balance and proportion, traditional design also incorporates other key principles and elements. These include rhythm, emphasis, and unity. Rhythm refers to the repetition of elements or patterns within a design, creating a sense of movement and flow. Emphasis is the use of a dominant element or feature to draw attention and create a focal point within the design. Unity is the overall coherence and consistency of the design, achieved through the careful integration of all elements.



The elements of traditional design include line, shape, form, texture, and color. These elements are used to create the visual and physical characteristics of a structure. Line refers to the use of straight or curved lines to define and connect elements within a design. Shape is the two-dimensional outline of an object, while form refers to the three-dimensional representation of an object. Texture is the surface quality of an element, and color is used to create visual interest and evoke emotions within a design.



By understanding and utilizing these principles and elements, architects can create designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional and harmonious. These traditional design principles have stood the test of time and continue to be relevant in modern architectural practices. In the following sections, we will explore how these principles are applied in different architectural styles and how they have been adapted to incorporate new technologies and techniques.

### Section: 1.1 Traditional Design Principles:



Traditional design principles are rooted in the concept of balance, which is achieved through the careful arrangement of elements within a structure. This balance can be symmetrical, where elements are mirrored on either side of a central axis, or asymmetrical, where elements are arranged in a way that creates a sense of equilibrium. Proportion is also a key principle in traditional design, as it ensures that elements are appropriately sized in relation to one another. This creates a sense of harmony and cohesion within the design. Additionally, traditional design principles also incorporate concepts of hierarchy, rhythm, and emphasis to create a visually appealing and functional structure.



#### 1.1a Balance:



Balance is a fundamental principle in traditional design and is achieved through the careful arrangement of elements within a structure. There are two types of balance commonly used in traditional design: symmetrical and asymmetrical. Symmetrical balance is achieved when elements are mirrored on either side of a central axis, creating a sense of equilibrium. This type of balance is often used in traditional architecture, such as classical Greek and Roman structures. On the other hand, asymmetrical balance is achieved when elements are arranged in a way that creates a sense of equilibrium without being mirrored. This type of balance is often used in modern architecture, where designers aim to create a sense of movement and dynamism within the structure.



#### 1.1b Proportion:



Proportion is another key principle in traditional design, and it refers to the relationship between the size of elements within a structure. In traditional design, proportions are often based on mathematical ratios, such as the golden ratio, which is believed to create a sense of harmony and balance within a design. Proportion is crucial in creating a visually appealing structure, as it ensures that elements are appropriately sized in relation to one another.



#### 1.1c Hierarchy, Rhythm, and Emphasis:



In addition to balance and proportion, traditional design principles also incorporate concepts of hierarchy, rhythm, and emphasis. Hierarchy refers to the organization of elements within a structure, where certain elements are given more importance than others. This creates a sense of order and clarity within the design. Rhythm is the repetition of elements within a structure, creating a sense of movement and flow. Emphasis is the use of certain elements to draw attention and create a focal point within the design. These principles work together to create a visually appealing and functional structure.



### Section: 1.2 Traditional Design Processes:



Traditional design processes have evolved over time, but they still follow a similar framework. The process typically begins with research and analysis, where the designer gathers information about the project, such as site conditions, client needs, and budget. This is followed by the conceptual design phase, where the designer creates initial sketches and ideas for the structure. The design is then refined through iterations and feedback from the client. Once the design is finalized, detailed drawings and specifications are created for construction. Traditional design processes also involve collaboration with engineers, contractors, and other professionals to ensure the feasibility and functionality of the design.



### Section: 1.3 Design Tools and Techniques:



Traditional design processes have traditionally relied on hand drafting as the primary tool for creating drawings and plans. Hand drafting involves using drafting tools, such as rulers and compasses, to create precise and accurate drawings.
