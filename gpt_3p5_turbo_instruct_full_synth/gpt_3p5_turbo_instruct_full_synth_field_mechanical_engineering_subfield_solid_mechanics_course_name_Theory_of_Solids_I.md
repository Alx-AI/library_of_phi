## Chapter: Textbook for Theory of Solids I



### Introduction



The study of solids is a fundamental aspect of physics, with applications ranging from materials science to condensed matter physics. In this chapter, we will introduce the free electron model, which is a simplified model used to describe the behavior of electrons in solids. This model is based on the assumption that the electrons in a solid are free to move and are not influenced by the surrounding atoms. While this may seem like a drastic simplification, the free electron model has been successful in explaining many properties of solids, such as electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity.



In this chapter, we will cover the basic concepts of the free electron model, including the assumptions and limitations of the model. We will also discuss the concept of band structure, which is a key aspect of the model. Additionally, we will explore the concept of Fermi energy, which plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of electrons in solids. Finally, we will discuss the applications of the free electron model and its limitations in describing the behavior of real solids.



Overall, this chapter will provide a solid foundation for understanding the behavior of electrons in solids and will serve as a starting point for further exploration into the fascinating world of condensed matter physics. So let's dive in and explore the free electron model in more detail. 





## Chapter 1: Free Electron Model:



### Section 1.1: Crystalline Lattice:



The study of solids is a fundamental aspect of physics, with applications ranging from materials science to condensed matter physics. In this chapter, we will introduce the free electron model, which is a simplified model used to describe the behavior of electrons in solids. This model is based on the assumption that the electrons in a solid are free to move and are not influenced by the surrounding atoms. While this may seem like a drastic simplification, the free electron model has been successful in explaining many properties of solids, such as electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity.



In this section, we will discuss the concept of a crystalline lattice, which is the underlying structure of most solids. A crystalline lattice is a regular, repeating arrangement of atoms or molecules in a solid. This arrangement is responsible for the unique properties of different types of solids, such as their melting points and mechanical strength.



#### Subsection 1.1a: Definition of a Crystal Structure



A crystal structure is defined as a three-dimensional arrangement of atoms or molecules in a solid that repeats itself in all directions. This means that the arrangement of atoms or molecules is the same when viewed from any direction. This regularity is what gives crystals their characteristic shape and properties.



The atoms or molecules in a crystal are held together by chemical bonds, which are strong forces of attraction between the particles. These bonds determine the overall structure of the crystal and its physical properties. The arrangement of atoms or molecules in a crystal can be described by a unit cell, which is the smallest repeating unit of the crystal lattice.



The most common types of crystal structures are the cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic structures. Each of these structures has a unique arrangement of atoms or molecules, resulting in different physical properties. For example, diamond and graphite both have a cubic crystal structure, but their properties are vastly different due to the arrangement of their atoms.



Understanding the crystal structure of a solid is crucial in the study of the free electron model. The regularity of the crystal lattice allows for the simplification of the model, making it easier to describe the behavior of electrons in solids. In the next section, we will explore the concept of band structure, which is a key aspect of the free electron model.

#### Subsection 1.1b: Unit Cell and Lattice Parameters



The unit cell is the basic building block of a crystal lattice and is used to describe the arrangement of atoms or molecules in a crystal. It is the smallest repeating unit of the crystal lattice and is used to represent the entire crystal structure. The unit cell is typically chosen to be the simplest possible shape that can be repeated in all three dimensions to create the crystal lattice.



The lattice parameters are a set of values that describe the size and shape of the unit cell. These parameters include the length of the sides of the unit cell, the angles between the sides, and the positions of the atoms or molecules within the unit cell. The lattice parameters are important in determining the physical properties of a crystal, such as its density and melting point.



In summary, the unit cell and lattice parameters are essential concepts in understanding the structure and properties of crystals. They provide a way to describe the repeating arrangement of atoms or molecules in a crystal lattice and play a crucial role in the free electron model of solids. In the next section, we will explore the implications of the free electron model on the behavior of electrons in a crystalline lattice.

This arrangement is responsible for the unique properties of different types of solids, such as their melting points and mechanical strength.



### Section 1.1: Crystalline Lattice:



#### Subsection 1.1c: Bravais Lattice



A Bravais lattice is a specific type of crystalline lattice that describes the arrangement of atoms or molecules in a crystal. It is named after the French mathematician Auguste Bravais, who first described these lattices in the 19th century.



A Bravais lattice is defined by a set of lattice points, which are points in space that represent the positions of the atoms or molecules in the crystal. These lattice points are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern, and the entire crystal can be constructed by translating this pattern in all three dimensions.



There are 14 possible Bravais lattices, which can be classified into seven crystal systems: cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic, and rhombohedral. Each crystal system has a unique set of lattice parameters, which describe the size and shape of the unit cell.



The most common type of Bravais lattice is the simple cubic lattice, which consists of lattice points at the corners of a cube. This lattice is often used to model the structure of metals, such as copper and aluminum.



Other common Bravais lattices include the face-centered cubic lattice, which has additional lattice points at the center of each face of the cube, and the body-centered cubic lattice, which has an additional lattice point at the center of the cube. These lattices are often used to model the structure of ionic compounds, such as sodium chloride.



In summary, the concept of a Bravais lattice is essential in understanding the structure and properties of crystals. By describing the arrangement of atoms or molecules in a crystal, Bravais lattices provide a framework for studying the behavior of solids using the free electron model. In the next section, we will discuss the properties of these lattices in more detail.

### Section 1.1: Crystalline Lattice:



#### Subsection 1.1d: Miller Indices



In the previous subsection, we discussed the concept of a Bravais lattice, which describes the arrangement of atoms or molecules in a crystal. However, in order to fully understand the structure of a crystal, we also need to consider the orientation of the lattice planes within the crystal. This is where Miller indices come into play.



Miller indices are a notation system used to describe the orientation of lattice planes within a crystal. They were first introduced by William Hallowes Miller in 1839 and are widely used in crystallography.



To understand Miller indices, we first need to define the concept of a lattice plane. A lattice plane is a plane that passes through a set of lattice points in a crystal. These planes are parallel to each other and are responsible for the regular, repeating pattern of the crystal lattice.



Miller indices are denoted by three numbers, (hkl), where h, k, and l are integers that represent the intercepts of the plane with the x, y, and z axes, respectively. These numbers are determined by taking the reciprocals of the intercepts and then reducing them to the smallest set of integers. For example, a plane that intercepts the x-axis at 1/2, the y-axis at 1/3, and the z-axis at 1/4 would have Miller indices of (2,3,4).



Miller indices are useful for describing the orientation of lattice planes because they are independent of the unit cell size and shape. This means that the same set of Miller indices can be used to describe the orientation of a lattice plane in different crystals, as long as they have the same lattice type.



In summary, Miller indices provide a convenient notation system for describing the orientation of lattice planes within a crystal. They are an essential tool for understanding the structure of crystals and are widely used in materials science and condensed matter physics.

However, in order to fully understand the structure of a crystal, we also need to consider the orientation of the lattice planes within the crystal. This is where Miller indices come into play.

Now, let's consider the thermal vibrations of atoms in a crystal lattice. Atoms in a crystal are not stationary, but rather vibrate around their equilibrium positions due to thermal energy. The Debye-Waller factor, denoted by the symbol W, is a measure of this thermal vibration. It is defined as the ratio of the mean square displacement of an atom from its equilibrium position to the square of the amplitude of its vibration.



$$
W = \frac{\langle u^2 \rangle}{u_0^2}
$$



where u is the displacement of an atom from its equilibrium position and u_0 is the amplitude of its vibration.



The Debye-Waller factor is important in understanding the behavior of incommensurate structures, which are structures that do not have a regular, repeating pattern. In these structures, the Debye-Waller factor can vary significantly, indicating a high degree of thermal disorder.



In summary, the Debye-Waller factor is a crucial concept in understanding the thermal vibrations of atoms in a crystal lattice. It plays a significant role in the study of incommensurate structures and is an important factor to consider when analyzing the properties of solids.

To understand Miller indices, we first need to define the concept of a lattice plane. A lattice plane is a plane that passes through a set of lattice points, which are points where atoms or molecules are located in a crystal lattice. These planes are important because they determine the physical and chemical properties of a crystal.



Miller indices are a way to describe the orientation of these lattice planes. They are denoted by three numbers, (hkl), where h, k, and l are integers that represent the intercepts of the plane with the x, y, and z axes, respectively. The numbers are written in parentheses and separated by commas, with no spaces in between.



For example, a plane that intersects the x-axis at 1/2, the y-axis at 1/3, and the z-axis at 1/4 would be denoted as (2,3,4). This notation system allows us to easily describe the orientation of any lattice plane within a crystal.



Miller indices are also useful in determining the symmetry of a crystal. For example, if a crystal has a plane with Miller indices (hkl), then it will also have planes with indices (-hkl), (h-k-l), and (hkl). This is known as the law of rational indices and is a fundamental principle in crystallography.



In summary, Miller indices are a notation system used to describe the orientation of lattice planes within a crystal. They are denoted by three numbers, (hkl), and are useful in determining the symmetry of a crystal. In the next section, we will explore the concept of a Debye-Waller factor and its role in understanding incommensurate structures.

These planes are important because they determine the physical and chemical properties of a crystal. Miller indices are a way to label and describe these planes.



The notation for Miller indices is (hkl), where h, k, and l are integers that represent the intercepts of the plane with the crystallographic axes. The intercepts are measured in terms of the lattice parameters, which are the lengths of the unit cell edges. The indices are enclosed in parentheses to distinguish them from other notations.



To determine the Miller indices for a given plane, we follow these steps:



1. Determine the intercepts of the plane with the crystallographic axes.

2. Take the reciprocals of the intercepts.

3. Multiply the reciprocals by a common factor to get the smallest set of integers.

4. Enclose the integers in parentheses to get the Miller indices.



For example, if a plane intercepts the x-axis at 1/2 of the lattice parameter, the y-axis at 1/3 of the lattice parameter, and the z-axis at 1/4 of the lattice parameter, the Miller indices for that plane would be (2,3,4).



Miller indices are useful because they allow us to easily describe the orientation of lattice planes and determine the symmetry of a crystal. In the next section, we will explore the concept of symmetry in crystals and how it relates to the point group for a Bravais lattice.

### Section 1.3: Point Group for Bravais Lattice:



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of a Bravais lattice and its symmetry. In this section, we will delve deeper into the symmetry of a Bravais lattice by introducing the concept of a point group.



A point group is a set of symmetry operations that leave a point in space unchanged. In the case of a Bravais lattice, the point of interest is the lattice point. The symmetry operations of a point group include rotations, reflections, and inversions. These operations can be combined to form a larger set of symmetry operations, known as the space group.



The point group for a Bravais lattice depends on the type of lattice and the arrangement of atoms or molecules within the lattice. For example, a simple cubic lattice has a point group of 23, while a face-centered cubic lattice has a point group of 432.

In the previous subsection, we introduced the concept of a point group and its relationship to the symmetry of a Bravais lattice. In this subsection, we will discuss the specific symmetry elements and operations that make up a point group.



Symmetry elements are imaginary lines, planes, or points that represent the symmetry of an object. In the case of a Bravais lattice, the symmetry elements are related to the arrangement of atoms or molecules within the lattice. These elements include rotation axes, mirror planes, and inversion centers.



Symmetry operations are the actual physical transformations that preserve the symmetry of an object. These operations include rotations, reflections, and inversions. For example, a rotation operation of 90 degrees around a rotation axis of a simple cubic lattice will result in the same arrangement of atoms.



Understanding the symmetry elements and operations of a point group is crucial in determining the physical and chemical properties of a crystal. It allows us to predict the behavior of a crystal under different conditions and provides a deeper understanding of the underlying structure of solids.

## Chapter 1: Free Electron Model:



The study of solids is a fundamental aspect of physics, with applications ranging from materials science to condensed matter physics. In this chapter, we will introduce the free electron model, which is a simplified model used to describe the behavior of electrons in solids. This model is based on the assumption that the electrons in a solid are free to move and are not influenced by the surrounding atoms. While this may seem like a drastic simplification, the free electron model has been successful in explaining many properties of solids, such as electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity.



In this section, we will discuss the concept of a crystalline lattice, which is the underlying structure of most solids. A crystalline lattice is a regular, repeating arrangement of atoms or molecules in a solid. This arrangement is responsible for the unique properties of different types of solids, such as their melting points and mechanical strength.



### Section 1.1: Crystalline Lattice:



#### Subsection 1.1d: Miller Indices



In the previous subsection, we discussed the concept of a Bravais lattice, which describes the arrangement of atoms or molecules in a crystal. However, in order to fully understand the structure of a crystal, we also need to consider the orientation of the lattice planes within the crystal. This is where Miller indices come into play.



Miller indices are a notation system used to describe the orientation of lattice planes within a crystal. They were first introduced by William Hallowes Miller in 1839 and are widely used in crystallography.



To understand Miller indices, we first need to define the concept of a lattice plane. A lattice plane is a plane that intersects the crystal lattice in such a way that it passes through lattice points. These lattice points are the points where the atoms or molecules are located in the crystal. The orientation of a lattice plane is described by its intersection with the three axes of the crystal lattice, denoted by the letters a, b, and c. The Miller indices of a lattice plane are denoted by three numbers (h, k, l), where h, k, and l are the reciprocals of the intercepts of the plane with the a, b, and c axes, respectively.



For example, if a plane intersects the a axis at a distance of 1 unit, the b axis at a distance of 2 units, and the c axis at a distance of 3 units, its Miller indices would be (1, 2, 3). If a plane is parallel to an axis, its intercept is considered to be infinity, and its Miller index is denoted by a bar over the corresponding letter. For example, a plane parallel to the a axis would have a Miller index of (1, ∞, ∞).



Miller indices are useful in determining the symmetry of a crystal, as they can be used to identify equivalent planes and directions within the crystal. This is important in understanding the physical properties of a crystal, as the symmetry of the crystal affects its behavior.



### Section: 1.3 Point Group for Bravais Lattice:



#### Subsection: 1.3c Bravais Lattice and Point Group



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of a Bravais lattice and its importance in understanding the structure of a crystal. Now, we will delve deeper into the symmetry of a Bravais lattice by introducing the concept of a point group.



A point group is a set of symmetry operations that leave a point in space unchanged. In the case of a Bravais lattice, the point of reference is a lattice point. The point group for a Bravais lattice describes the symmetry of the lattice, taking into account all possible translations, rotations, and reflections that leave the lattice unchanged.



There are 32 possible point groups for a Bravais lattice, which are classified into seven crystal systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic. Each crystal system has a unique set of symmetry operations that define its point group.



For example, the cubic crystal system has a point group of 432, which includes rotations of 90 degrees around the x, y, and z axes, as well as reflections across the x, y, and z planes. This point group has a total of 24 symmetry operations, which can be represented by a 4x4 matrix.



Understanding the point group of a Bravais lattice is crucial in determining the physical properties of a crystal. The symmetry of a crystal affects its optical, electrical, and mechanical properties, making it an important factor to consider in materials science and condensed matter physics.



In the next section, we will explore the relationship between the point group and the lattice system, and how they work together to define the symmetry of a crystal.

A lattice plane is a plane that intersects the crystal lattice in such a way that it passes through a set of lattice points. These lattice points are the points where the atoms or molecules are located in the crystal. The orientation of a lattice plane is described by its intersection with the three axes of the crystal lattice.



Miller indices are written as three numbers enclosed in parentheses, with no commas between them. The numbers represent the reciprocals of the intercepts of the plane with the three axes. For example, a plane that intersects the x-axis at 1/2, the y-axis at 1/3, and the z-axis at 1/4 would be denoted as (2,3,4).

To understand Miller indices, we first need to define the concept of a lattice plane. A lattice plane is a plane that passes through a set of lattice points and divides the crystal into two halves. These planes are important because they determine the physical and chemical properties of a crystal.



To describe the orientation of a lattice plane, we use a set of three numbers, known as Miller indices. These numbers represent the reciprocals of the intercepts of the plane on the three axes of the crystal. For example, if a plane intersects the x-axis at a distance of 1 unit, the y-axis at a distance of 2 units, and the z-axis at a distance of 3 units, the Miller indices for that plane would be (1,2,3).



Miller indices are written within parentheses and are separated by commas. If a plane is parallel to an axis, the corresponding Miller index is written as 0. For example, a plane parallel to the x-axis would have a Miller index of (0,2,3).



One of the key advantages of using Miller indices is that they can be used to describe any plane within a crystal, regardless of its orientation. This makes it a powerful tool for crystallography and materials science.



### Subsection 1.4b: Bloch Theorem and Bloch Functions



In the previous subsection, we discussed the concept of a Bravais lattice and how it describes the arrangement of atoms or molecules in a crystal. However, in order to fully understand the behavior of electrons in a crystal, we also need to consider the periodic potential that the lattice creates. This is where the Bloch theorem and Bloch functions come into play.



The Bloch theorem, named after Swiss physicist Felix Bloch, states that the wavefunction of an electron in a periodic potential can be written as a product of a plane wave and a periodic function. This means that the wavefunction of an electron in a crystal can be described by a Bloch function, which is a periodic function with the same periodicity as the crystal lattice.



Mathematically, the Bloch theorem can be written as:



$$
\psi_{k}(r) = e^{ikr}u_{k}(r)
$$



where $\psi_{k}(r)$ is the wavefunction, $k$ is the wavevector, $r$ is the position vector, and $u_{k}(r)$ is the periodic function.



The Bloch theorem is a powerful tool in understanding the behavior of electrons in a crystal. It allows us to simplify the complex problem of solving the Schrödinger equation for a periodic potential into a simpler problem of solving for a Bloch function.



In addition to describing the wavefunction of an electron in a crystal, Bloch functions also play a crucial role in determining the electronic band structure of a material. The periodicity of the Bloch function leads to the formation of energy bands, which are ranges of allowed energies for electrons in a crystal.



In summary, the Bloch theorem and Bloch functions are essential concepts in the study of solids. They allow us to understand the behavior of electrons in a periodic potential and provide a powerful tool for analyzing the electronic properties of materials.

To understand Miller indices, we first need to define the concept of a lattice plane. A lattice plane is a plane that intersects the lattice points of a crystal. These planes can be described by their intercepts on the three axes of the crystal. Miller indices are a way to represent these intercepts in a compact and systematic manner.



The Miller indices notation is based on the reciprocal of the intercepts, represented by h, k, and l. These indices are enclosed in parentheses and written as (hkl). The indices are determined by taking the reciprocal of the intercepts and then reducing them to the smallest integer values. For example, if a plane intersects the x-axis at 1/2, the y-axis at 1/3, and the z-axis at 1/4, the Miller indices would be (2,3,4).



Miller indices are useful in determining the symmetry of a crystal and predicting its physical properties. For example, a crystal with a high symmetry will have a large number of equivalent planes, which can affect its mechanical and optical properties.



### Subsection 1.4c: Brillouin Zone



In the previous subsection, we discussed the concept of a Bravais lattice and its symmetry. However, in order to fully understand the electronic properties of a crystal, we also need to consider the behavior of electrons within the lattice. This is where the Brillouin zone comes into play.



The Brillouin zone is a concept in solid state physics that describes the behavior of electrons in a periodic potential. It is named after French physicist Léon Brillouin, who first introduced the concept in 1930. The Brillouin zone is a unit cell in reciprocal space that represents all possible wave vectors for electrons in a crystal.



To understand the Brillouin zone, we first need to define the concept of reciprocal space. Reciprocal space is a mathematical construct used to describe the periodicity of a crystal in terms of wave vectors. It is the Fourier transform of real space, which is the physical space we live in.



The Brillouin zone is a polyhedron that is constructed by connecting the midpoints of the reciprocal lattice vectors. It is a unique shape for each crystal and is used to determine the electronic band structure of a material. The Brillouin zone is important in understanding the electronic properties of a crystal, such as its electrical conductivity and optical properties.



In summary, the Brillouin zone is a crucial concept in solid state physics that helps us understand the behavior of electrons in a crystal. It is a powerful tool that allows us to predict and explain the electronic properties of materials, making it an essential topic in the study of solids.

To determine the Miller indices of a plane, we follow these steps:



1. Choose a lattice point as the origin.

2. Determine the intercepts of the plane with the three axes of the crystal.

3. Take the reciprocals of the intercepts.

4. Reduce the resulting numbers to the smallest integer values.

5. Enclose the numbers in parentheses, with no commas.



For example, if a plane intersects the x-axis at 1/2, the y-axis at 1/4, and the z-axis at 1/8, the Miller indices for this plane would be (2,4,8).



Miller indices are useful because they allow us to easily describe the orientation of lattice planes and predict the properties of a crystal based on its structure. In the next section, we will discuss the concept of energy bands and how they relate to the band structure of a crystal.

Miller indices are useful in determining the symmetry of a crystal and predicting its properties. For example, a crystal with a high degree of symmetry will have many planes with the same Miller indices, indicating a regular and repeating structure. On the other hand, a crystal with low symmetry will have a variety of different Miller indices, indicating a more irregular structure.



### Section: 1.5 Band Structure:



In the previous section, we discussed the concept of a crystalline lattice and its importance in determining the properties of solids. In this section, we will delve deeper into the electronic structure of solids and discuss the band structure.



The band structure of a solid refers to the distribution of energy levels or bands that are available to electrons in the solid. In the free electron model, we assume that the electrons in a solid are free to move and are not influenced by the surrounding atoms. However, in reality, the electrons are subject to the periodic potential of the crystal lattice, which leads to the formation of energy bands.



The energy bands in a solid can be classified into two types: the valence band and the conduction band. The valence band is the band of energy levels that are occupied by electrons at absolute zero temperature, while the conduction band is the band of energy levels that are empty at absolute zero temperature. The energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band is known as the band gap.



### Subsection 1.5b: Classification of Solids based on Band Structure



The band structure of a solid plays a crucial role in determining its properties. Based on the band structure, solids can be classified into three categories: metals, insulators, and semiconductors.



Metals have a partially filled conduction band, which allows electrons to move freely and contribute to the electrical conductivity of the material. This is why metals are good conductors of electricity.



Insulators, on the other hand, have a large band gap between the valence band and the conduction band, which makes it difficult for electrons to move from the valence band to the conduction band. This results in a very low electrical conductivity, making insulators poor conductors of electricity.



Semiconductors have a smaller band gap compared to insulators, which allows some electrons to move from the valence band to the conduction band at room temperature. This results in a moderate electrical conductivity, making semiconductors useful in electronic devices.



In summary, the band structure of a solid is a crucial factor in determining its properties and can be used to classify solids into different categories. This understanding of band structure is essential in the study of materials and has many practical applications in various fields of science and technology.

These planes can be described by their intercepts on the three axes of the crystal. The Miller indices of a plane are denoted by three integers, denoted as (hkl), where h, k, and l are the reciprocals of the intercepts on the x, y, and z axes respectively.



Now, let's move on to discussing the band structure of solids. In the free electron model, we assume that the electrons in a solid are free to move and are not influenced by the surrounding atoms. This means that they can occupy any energy level within the solid. However, due to the periodic arrangement of atoms in a crystal, the energy levels available to the electrons form bands, known as the valence band and the conduction band.



The valence band is the band of energy levels that are fully occupied by electrons, while the conduction band is the band of energy levels that are empty or partially filled. The energy gap between these two bands is known as the band gap. In insulators, this gap is large, while in conductors, it is small or non-existent.



The effective mass of an electron in a solid is a measure of how it behaves in the presence of an electric field. In the free electron model, the effective mass is equal to the mass of a free electron. However, in real solids, the effective mass can vary depending on the band structure and the crystal structure.



The density of states is another important concept in the study of band structure. It describes the number of energy states available to electrons at a given energy level. In the free electron model, the density of states is constant, but in real solids, it can vary depending on the band structure and the crystal structure.



In summary, the band structure of solids is a crucial concept in understanding the behavior of electrons in solids. It is affected by the crystal structure, the arrangement of atoms, and the energy levels available to electrons. The effective mass and density of states are important parameters that can vary in real solids and affect their properties.
